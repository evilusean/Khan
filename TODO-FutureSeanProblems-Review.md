Sum/Difference of Cubes 
- **Sum of Two Cubes** : $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **negative** middle term and always has a **positive** last term. '+' positive first parenthesis in (x +y) , '-' negative first term on second parenthesis : *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*
- **Difference of Two Cubes** : $x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **positive** middle term and always has a **positive** last term.  '-' negative first parenthesis in (x - y) , '+' positive terms on second parenthesis *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*

Rational Expressions

Complex Fractions with Rational Expressions

Radicals - Exponent Form (This still doesn't make sense to me, the numerator and denominator become what?)

Factoring and using the **Zero Product Property** ($x^2 + x + c = 0$) to find the solutions - Quadratic Trinomial, Difference of Squares, 

- **Quadratic Formula** : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ : a universal tool that provides the solutions (or roots) for any quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx+c=0$ , regardless of whether the solutions are real or complex.
