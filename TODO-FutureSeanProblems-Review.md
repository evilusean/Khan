**Future Sean** : Besides anki card reviews, try to do these in a few months, if you forget in a few months (likely), watch some https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA - The Organic Chemistry Tutor - Videos on whatever subject, he does a very good job explaining with examples quickly almost every math subject I've come accross (can also add those to anki for Future Future Sean) - Right now, I'm just trying to finish Algebra2 by the end of the month, and don't have much time to practice / review so I can start precalc fresh in december

Create a cheetsheet with most used formulas I learned in Algebra I + II

- [x]  Study factoring polynomials with coefficients 

- [x] Study adding/subtracting rational expressions

Practice Motion word problems (if a train leaves at.... going...) d=rt

**I = Prt** : Interest = Principal * rate * time

- [x] Solving Systems of Linear Equations in three Variables

- [x] 📅 Matrix Operations - totally forgot how to do these - When you're ready Neo, you won't have to. - 3 row operations : 
- [x] 1) interchange any two rows
- [x] 1) multiply any row by a non-zero number
- [x] 1) multiply  a row by a real number and add this to the corresponding elements of any other row

- [x] Sum/Difference of Cubes 
- [x] **Sum of Two Cubes** : $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **negative** middle term and always has a **positive** last term. '+' positive first parenthesis in (x +y) , '-' negative first term on second parenthesis : *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*
- [x] **Difference of Two Cubes** : $x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **positive** middle term and always has a **positive** last term.  '-' negative first parenthesis in (x - y) , '+' positive terms on second parenthesis *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*
- [x] **SOAP** = **S**ame **O**pposite **AP** Always Positive = for matching the signs, once you memorize this, its much easier ✅ 2025-12-12

- [x] Rational Expressions

- [x] Complex Fractions with Rational Expressions

- [x] Radicals - Exponent Form (This still doesn't make sense to me, the numerator and denominator become what?)

- [x] Factoring and using the **Zero Product Property** ($x^2 + x + c = 0$) to find the solutions - Quadratic Trinomial, Difference of Squares, 

- [x] $i$ imaginary numbers, I still have no idea what a '-i' is despite writing it down - I thought that the entire purpose of '-i' is to transfer the negative outside of a square root, but if we negative a negative... what?

- [x] **Quadratic Formula** : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ : a universal tool that provides the solutions (or roots) for any quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx+c=0$ , regardless of whether the solutions are real or complex.
- [x] Quadratics - converting between forms - I still don't understand the concept 'Cut it in half and square it' and how that gives the answer while equation stays balanced - It's to 'complete the square and get a perfect square trinomial' to get right form - also using the vertex formula, substituting in ($\frac{-b}{2a}$) $f(\frac{-b}{-2a}$) and plugging in 'h' to get 'k', Ohhh, I see now, you get the 'x' value, and then plug that into the standard form equation to get 'y', need to practice : ✅ 2025-12-19
- [x] **Standard Form** : $f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c$ 
- [x] **Vertex Form** : $a(x-h)^2 + k$ ✅ 2025-12-19
- [x] **Vertex Formula** (from standard form) : $\mathbf{f(x) = a\left(x - \left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}\right)}$ : The expressions for the vertex components are: * **$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$,** $k = \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}$ 

- [x] Solving/Graphing Quadratic Inequalities and Rational Inequalities 

- [x] Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (Logarithmic Form Vs Exponential Form) : ✅ 2025-12-21
- [x] **Logarithmic Function** : $f(x) = \log_a(x)$ : $a > 0, x > 0, a \neq 1$ : **Base ($a$):** Must be a positive number and cannot be equal to 1. **Argument ($x$):** Must be strictly positive ($x > 0$), which defines the **domain** of the function. : ✅ 2025-12-21
- [x] **Exponential Function** : $f(x) = a^x$ : $a > 0, a \ne 1$ where 'x' is any real number greater than 0 and 'a' is not 1 $$\mathbf{\text{Exponential Form: } a^y = x \quad \iff \quad \text{Logarithmic Form: } y = \log_a(x)}$$ ✅ 2025-12-21
