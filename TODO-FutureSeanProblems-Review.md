- $i$ imaginary numbers, I still have no idea what a '-i' is despite writing it down - I thought that the entire purpose of '-i' is to transfer the negative outside of a square root, but if we negative a negative... what?

- **Quadratic Formula** : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ : a universal tool that provides the solutions (or roots) for any quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx+c=0$ , regardless of whether the solutions are real or complex.
- Quadratics - converting between forms - I still don't understand the concept 'Cut it in half and square it' and how that gives the answer while equation stays balanced - It's to 'complete the square and get a perfect square trinomial' to get right form - also using the vertex formula, substituting in ($\frac{-b}{2a}$) $f(\frac{-b}{-2a}$) and plugging in 'h' to get 'k', Ohhh, I see now, you get the 'x' value, and then plug that into the standard form equation to get 'y', need to practice : 
  - **Standard Form** : $f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c$ 
- **Vertex Form** : $a(x-h)^2 + k$ 
  - **Vertex Formula** (from standard form) : $\mathbf{f(x) = a\left(x - \left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}\right)}$ : The expressions for the vertex components are: * **$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$,** $k = \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}$

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (Logarithmic Form Vs Exponential Form) :
**Logarithmic Function** : $f(x) = \log_a(x)$ : $a > 0, x > 0, a \neq 1$ : **Base ($a$):** Must be a positive number and cannot be equal to 1. **Argument ($x$):** Must be strictly positive ($x > 0$), which defines the **domain** of the function. : 
**Exponential Function** : $f(x) = a^x$ : $a > 0, a \ne 1$ where 'x' is any real number greater than 0 and 'a' is not 1
The general rule for conversion is:
$$\mathbf{\text{Exponential Form: } a^y = x \quad \iff \quad \text{Logarithmic Form: } y = \log_a(x)}$$

|     Term     | Role in Exponential ($a^y = x$) | Role in Logarithmic ($\log_a(x) = y$) | Value in Example |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|   **Base**   |               $a$               |            $a$ (subscript)            |        10        |

Expanding/Condensing + Properties of Logarithms :
- **Product Rule for Logarithms** : $log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)$ : 'x', 'y', and 'b' are positive real numbesr and $b \ne 1$ - You can also reverse the process/condense 
- **Quotient Rule for Logarithms** : $log_b(\frac{x}{y}) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)$ : 'x', 'y', and 'b' are positive real numbesr and $b \ne 1$ - Subtraction instead of addition
- **Power Rule for Logarithms** : $log_b(x^r) = r \cdot log_b(x)$ : 'x', and 'b' are positive real numbesr and $b \ne 1$, 'r' is any real number : Exponent just comes down and goes in front
- $b^{log_b(x)} = x$ : if you see something 'b' raised to the power of log base 'b' to 'x' you will get 'x' as the solution. restrictions: $b > 0, b \ne 1, x >0$ : I'm not even going to pretend I understand why this works. Future Sean Problems. something something about base being raised to the power to get 7. 
- $log_b(b^x) = x$ : log base 'b' of 'b' to the 'x' is equal to 'x' = 'b' raised to the power of 'x' will give you 'b' to the power or 'x' : restrictions $b > 0, b \ne 1$

### 🔑 The One-to-One Property of Exponential Functions

This property establishes the equivalence between the exponents when the bases are equal, and vice-versa. It is the core principle used to solve many exponential equations.

#### 1. The Property

The exponential function $f(x) = b^x$ is a **one-to-one function** (meaning every $x$ value maps to a unique $y$ value), which gives rise to two forms of this property:

* **Form 1 (If exponents are equal):**
    If the exponents are equal, the powers are equal.
    $$\text{If } \mathbf{x = y}\text{, then } \mathbf{b^x = b^y}$$

* **Form 2 (If powers are equal):**
    If the bases are the same and the powers are equal, then the exponents must be equal. This is the form most commonly used to solve equations.
    $$\text{If } \mathbf{b^x = b^y}\text{, then } \mathbf{x = y}$$

---

#### 2. Restrictions

The property holds under the standard restrictions for an exponential base:
* $b > 0$: The base must be **positive**.
* $b \neq 1$: The base cannot be **one** (since $1^x = 1^y$ is always true, regardless of $x$ and $y$).

***

#### 💡 Key Takeaway for Solving Equations

To solve an exponential equation using this property (like $2^{3x-3} = 64$), you must first manipulate both sides of the equation so they have the **same base** ($\mathbf{b^x = b^y}$). Once the bases are the same, you can equate the exponents and solve the resulting linear or quadratic equation ($\mathbf{x = y}$).
### 📝 One-to-One Property of Logarithms

This property highlights the equivalence between equality of arguments and equality of logarithms with the same base.

**The Property:**

If: $x = y$
Then: $\log_b(x) = \log_b(y)$

If: $\log_b(x) = \log_b(y)$
Then: $x = y$

**Conditions for the Property:**

For: $x > 0, y > 0, b > 0, b \neq 1$

---

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The **One-to-One Property** is crucial for solving logarithmic equations. If you have a single logarithm on both sides of an equation with the same base, you can simply set their arguments equal to each other to solve for the variable.
