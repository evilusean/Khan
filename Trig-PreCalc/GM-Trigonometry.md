https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY
- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
- **Right Angle** : Exactly 90 Degrees
- **Obtuse Angle** : Greater than 90 degrees, less than 180 degrees
- **Straight Angle** : 180 degrees
- **Complementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 90 degrees, they are *complementary*
- **Supplementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 180 degrees, they are *supplementary*
## 2026-January-04 - Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=12m10s
- $1\degree$ = $\frac{1}{360}$ : 360 degrees in a circle 
- What happens when you need to measure a rotation that is less than a degree? *Minutes*, and *seconds* are portions/fractions of a degree.
- $125^\circ 30' 45''$ : Standard Notation for *Degrees $\degree$*, *Minutes $'$*, *Seconds $''$* 
- $60'$ = $\frac{1\degree}{60}$ : $60'$ minutes in one degree ($1\degree$)
- $60''$ = $\frac{1'}{60}$ : $60''$ seconds in one minute($1'$)
- $1'' = \frac{1'}{60} = \frac{1\degree}{3600}$ : 1 second is 1/3600th (60 * 60) of a degree
- $37^\circ 15' 45''$ + $19^\circ 50' 17''$  = $57^\circ 6' 2''$ : Once you understand it, you just need to know the carrying process (every 60 seconds is a minute, every 60 minutes is a degree)
- $14^\circ 18' 30''$ - $9^\circ 25' 50''$ = $4\degree 52' 40''$ 
- To find the complement(what adds up to 90 degrees), just borrow from the degrees for the minutes, and borrow from those new minutes for the seconds
- $114.09\degree$ = $114\degree 5' 24''$ : How to go from Decimal form to degrees, minutes and seconds. simply multiply the fractional degree (in this case, '0.09' = 5.4) by 60, then take whatever fractional part is remaining('0.4' * 60 = 24) and multiply that by 60 again for the seconds 
- If you have a TI 83 / 84 : type the number(fractional degrees)  into the calculator look for the **Angle** button, then press **DMS** button and it will convert it for you
- To convert from degrees minutes seconds to a fractional degree, simply divide the *seconds $'$* by '60' and the *minutes* by '3600' then add that to your degrees
## 2026-January-04 - Angles in Standard Position and Coterminal Angles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=24m55s
### Trigonometry: Angles in Standard Position & Coterminal Angles

#### 1. Angles in Standard Position
An angle is in **standard position** when its vertex is at the origin $(0,0)$ of the Cartesian plane and its **initial side** lies along the positive x-axis.

* **Positive Angles:** Measured **counterclockwise** from the initial side.
* **Negative Angles:** Measured **clockwise** from the initial side.
* **Terminal Side:** The ray where the angle measurement ends.
* **Quadrantal Angles:** Angles whose terminal sides lie exactly on an axis ($0^\circ, 90^\circ, 180^\circ, 270^\circ$, etc.).

#### 2. Coterminal Angles
Coterminal angles are angles in standard position that share the same **terminal side**. Although they look the same on a graph, they have different measures because they differ by one or more full rotations.

**Finding Coterminal Angles:**
To find an angle coterminal to a given angle $\theta$, add or subtract multiples of $360^\circ$ (for degrees) or $2\pi$ (for radians).

* **Degrees:** $\theta \pm 360^\circ n$
* **Radians:** $\theta \pm 2\pi n$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Term | Definition | Formula / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Side** | Starting ray of the angle | Always the positive x-axis. |
| **Terminal Side** | Ending ray of the angle | Determines the quadrant. |
| **Positive Angle** | Counterclockwise rotation | Example: $+120^\circ$ |
| **Negative Angle** | Clockwise rotation | Example: $-45^\circ$ |
| **Coterminal** | Different measures, same terminal side | Add/Subtract $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$. |

#### 4. Practice Examples
* **Find a positive coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ + 360^\circ = 405^\circ$
* **Find a negative coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ - 360^\circ = -315^\circ$
* **Find the smallest positive coterminal angle for $\frac{13\pi}{4}$:**
    $\frac{13\pi}{4} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$
## 2026-January-05 - Angles Relationship and Similar Triangles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=34m30s
### Vertical Angles :
- **Vertical Angles** : Angles that are opposite eachother where the 2 lines cross - The opposite side angles will be the same equal measures
![[Pasted image 20260105142242.png]]
- 1 and 3 are opposites and will be the same
- 2 and 4 are opposites and will be the same
- 1 and 2 are supplementary angles and will add up to 180 degrees
- 3 and 4 are supplementary as well and will also add up to 180 degrees
### Transversal intersects 2 parallel Lines : 
![[Pasted image 20260105142125.png]]
- **Interior Angles** Are the angles on the interior of the parallel lines
- **Alternate Interior Angles** : are angles that will have equal measures (3 and 6, 5 and 4)
- 3 and 6 will be the equal angle measurements
- 4 and 5 will be the equal angle measurements
- **Exterior Angles** : Are the angles outside the interior parallel lines
- **Alternate Exterior Angles** : Alternate Exterior Angles will have exterior measures (1 and 8, 2 and 7)
- 2 and 7 will be the equal angle measurements
- 1 and 8 will be the equal angle measurements
- Since 7 and 8 are supplementary angles(add up to 180), and 2 = 7 : 
  7 :$(11x-53)\degree$
  8 : $(4x+8)\degree$ 
  7+ 8 : $11x -53 +4x + 8 = 180\degree$
  15x - 45 = 180
  15x = 225
  x = 15 
  Plug x into the angles to get their measurement 
  2 and 7 :  $(11x-53)\degree$ : 11(15) - 53 : 165 - 53 : $112\degree$
  1 and 8 :  $(4x+8)\degree$ : 4(15) + 8 : $68\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so : 7, 6, 2, 3 = $112\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so 1, 4, 5 , 8 = $68\degree$ 
### Triangle Sum 180
![[Pasted image 20260105144919.png]]
- The sum of the measure of any triangle will always be 180 degrees
- 6x + 1 + 10x - 56 + 43 = 180 : 16x -12 = 180 : 16x  = 192 : x = 12
- Plug 12 into x for the other 2 angles :
  1: 6(12) + 1 : $73\degree$ 
  2: 10(12) - 56 : $64\degree$ 
  3 : $43\degree$ 
  Check : $73\degree + 64\degree + 43\degree = 180\degree$ 
### Similar Triangles :
![[Pasted image 20260105145810.png]]
- Similar Triangles Must have the same measure of angles 
- corresponding angles must have same measures
- So A = D, F = C, E = B
  A and  D = $18\degree$ 
  F and C = $144\degree$ 
  All triangles add up to 180 degrees :
  B and E = $180\degree - 144\degree - 18\degree = 18\degree$
### Similar Triangles, Missing Side Lengths :
![[Pasted image 20260105150638.png]]
- Since the length of side BA and ED are the same angles, and the length is 15 on BA and 30 on ED (doubled) the similar triangles are just double the size for triangle EDF, so just double the size of the sides :
  $\triangle ABC$ ~  $\triangle DEF$ : Triangle ABC is similar(~) to Triangle DEF
  BA = 15 :   ED = 30
  AC = 24 :   DF = 48
  BC = 30.5 :   EF = 61
- For similar triangles : Corresponding Sides must be equal, and corresponding sides must be *proportional*
## 2026-January-05 - Trigonometric Functions :

### Trigonometric Values for the Point $(9, -9)$

To find the six trigonometric functions for the point $(x, y) = (9, -9)$, we first determine the distance from the origin $r$.

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
Using the distance formula simplified for the origin:

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
* $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{9 + 9}$
* $r = \sqrt{18}$
* $r = 3\sqrt{2}$

#### The Six Trigonometric Functions

## 2026-January-06 - Reciprocal Identities, Signs of Trigonometric Function Values, Finding Missing Function Values :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h5m30s
- **SOH-CAH-TOA** (Sine=Opposite(y) over Hypoteneuse(r), Cosine = Adjacent(x) over Hypoteneuse(r), Tangent = Opposite(y) over Adjacent(x))
- **Recipricoals** : Sine+Cosecant(S with C) - Cosine+Secant(C with S) - Tangent+CoTangent (Tan with Tan)
- If you know one(like sine), you automatically know the other(its reciprocal, Cosecant) by simply flipping the fraction.
- 
### Why To use Trig Functions? Practical Use? 
- You know **one angle** (besides the 90°) and **one side** → find everything else.
- You know **two sides** → find all angles and the remaining side.
In a **right triangle**, you always have one 90° angle. To determine the entire triangle (all sides and both acute angles), you need **any two** of the following three pieces:
1. One acute angle + one side (any side)
2. Two sides (any two of the three sides)
Key rule: In a right triangle, any 2 pieces (excluding knowing just the right angle) are enough to find everything else.
### Trig Functions with Reciprocals :
- **sin θ** = y / r  → 
  **csc θ** = r / y (y ≠ 0)
- **cos θ** = x / r → 
  **sec θ** = r / x (x ≠ 0)
- **tan θ** = y / x (x ≠ 0) → 
  **cot θ** = x / y (y ≠ 0)
### Reciprocal Identities

These identities define the relationship between the primary trigonometric functions and their reciprocal counterparts.

* $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}$
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$
* $\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta}$
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$
* $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$

#### Quotient Identities
In addition to the reciprocal values, these functions can be expressed as ratios of sine and cosine:

* $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant
![[Pasted image 20260106151753.png]]
The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$.

#### 1. Quadrant Sign Analysis
The signs are derived from the coordinates in each quadrant, where $r$ (the radius) is always positive:
* **Quadrant I:** $x > 0, y > 0$. All ratios are positive.
* **Quadrant II:** $x < 0, y > 0$. Only $\sin \theta$ and $\csc \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant III:** $x < 0, y < 0$. Only $\tan \theta$ and $\cot \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant IV:** $x > 0, y < 0$. Only $\cos \theta$ and $\sec \theta$ are positive.

#### 2. Trigonometric Sign Table
| Quadrant | $\sin \theta$ | $\cos \theta$ | $\tan \theta$ | $\cot \theta$ | $\sec \theta$ | $\csc \theta$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **I** | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **III** | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **IV** | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Definitions of the 6 Functions
The signs in the table above are based on these fundamental ratios:
* $\sin \theta = y/r$
* $\cos \theta = x/r$
* $\tan \theta = y/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\csc \theta = r/y, (y \neq 0)$
* $\sec \theta = r/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\cot \theta = x/y, (y \neq 0)$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant

The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$. 

* **$x$ is positive** in Quadrants I and IV.
* **$y$ is positive** in Quadrants I and II.
* **$r$ (radius)** is always positive.

#### 1. The "All Students Take Calculus" Mnemonic
A common way to remember which functions are **positive** in each quadrant:
* **A**ll (Quadrant I): **A**ll functions are positive.
* **S**tudents (Quadrant II): **S**ine (and cosecant) are positive.
* **T**ake (Quadrant III): **T**angent (and cotangent) are positive.
* **C**alculus (Quadrant IV): **C**osine (and secant) are positive.

#### 2. Quadrant Sign Table

| Quadrant | $\sin$ / $\csc$ ($y$) | $\cos$ / $\sec$ ($x$) | $\tan$ / $\cot$ ($y/x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** ($90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$) | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **III** ($180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$) | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **IV** ($270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$) | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Detailed Breakdown
* **Quadrant I (All $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are positive. Every ratio is positive.
* **Quadrant II (Sine $+$):** $y$ is positive, but $x$ is negative. Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, it remains positive. $\cos \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $x$, so they are negative.
* **Quadrant III (Tangent $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are negative. $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ are negative, but $\tan \theta = y/x$ becomes positive (negative divided by negative).
* **Quadrant IV (Cosine $+$):** $x$ is positive, but $y$ is negative. Since $\cos \theta = x/r$, it remains positive. $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $y$, so they are negative.

### Solving for Cosine using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the secant function, we can find the cosine value using the reciprocal relationship between the two.

#### Given

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$



#### Solution
1. Substitute the given value into the formula:
   $$\cos \theta = \frac{1}{9/2}$$
2. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
   $$\cos \theta = 1 \cdot \frac{2}{9}$$
3. Result:
   **$\cos \theta = \frac{2}{9}$**

#### Quick Reference
| Known Function              | Reciprocal                  | Method            |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| $\sec \theta = \frac{a}{b}$ | $\cos \theta = \frac{b}{a}$ | Flip the fraction |
### Solving for Cosecant using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the sine function, we can find the cosecant value using their reciprocal relationship.

#### Given
* $\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$

#### Solution
1. **Substitute the given value:**
   $$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}}$$

2. **Multiply by the reciprocal:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{6}}$$

3. **Rationalize the denominator:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{6}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{6}}{6}$$

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**

#### Quick Summary
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$**
* **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**
### Determining Quadrants using ASTC

To find the quadrant where $\cos \theta > 0$ and $\csc \theta < 0$, we analyze the signs of the trigonometric functions based on the **All Students Take Calculus** mnemonic.

#### 1. Analyze the Given Conditions
* **Condition 1: $\cos \theta > 0$ (Positive)**
    * According to **ASTC**, Cosine is positive in **Quadrant I** (All) and **Quadrant IV** (Calculus).
* **Condition 2: $\csc \theta < 0$ (Negative)**
    * Since $\csc \theta$ is the reciprocal of $\sin \theta$, it has the same sign as sine. 
    * Sine is positive in Quadrants I and II, so it is **negative** in **Quadrant III** and **Quadrant IV**.

#### 2. Find the Overlap
To satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we look for the quadrant common to both lists:
* $\cos \theta$ is positive in: {I, **IV**}
* $\csc \theta$ is negative in: {III, **IV**}

**Result:** The angle $\theta$ must lie in **Quadrant IV**.

#### 3. Quick Reference Summary
| Function Sign                             | Possible Quadrants |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| $\cos \theta > 0$                         | I, IV              |
| $\sin \theta < 0$ (same as $\csc \theta$) | III, IV            |
| **Intersection**                          | **Quadrant IV**    |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = 110^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for $110^\circ$, we first locate which quadrant the angle falls into and then apply the **ASTC (All Students Take Calculus)** rule.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Angle:** $110^\circ$
* **Boundary:** Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant II**.
#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant II** ("Students"):
* **Sine ($\sin$)** and its reciprocal **Cosecant ($\csc$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $110^\circ$

| $\cot 110^\circ$ | **$-$** | $x/y$ (Negative / Positive) |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = -150^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for a negative angle, we first find its position on the coordinate plane or identify its positive coterminal equivalent.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Rotation:** Starting from the positive x-axis, rotate **clockwise** $150^\circ$.
* **Coterminal Angle:** $-150^\circ + 360^\circ = 210^\circ$.
* **Boundary:** Since $180^\circ < 210^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant III** ("Take"):
* **Tangent ($\tan$)** and its reciprocal **Cotangent ($\cot$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** (Sine, Cosine, Cosecant, Secant) are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $-150^\circ$

### Determining Trigonometric Components for $\sec \theta = 19/11$ and $\sin \theta < 0$

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
To determine the quadrant, we analyze the signs of the given functions:
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$ (Positive). Since $\sec \theta = r/x$, $x$ must be positive. This occurs in **Quadrants I and IV**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, $y$ must be negative. This occurs in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side is located in **Quadrant IV**.


#### 2. Solve for $r$ and $x$
Using the definition of the secant function from the provided image:
* **Formula:** $\sec \theta = r/x$
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$
* **Identification:** * $r = 19$
    * $x = 11$

#### 3. Solve for $y$
Using the Pythagorean relationship $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:
* $11^2 + y^2 = 19^2$
* $121 + y^2 = 361$
* $y^2 = 361 - 121$
* $y^2 = 240$
* $y = \pm\sqrt{240} = \pm 4\sqrt{15}$

**Final Value for $y$:** Because the angle is in **Quadrant IV**, $y$ must be negative:
* **$y = -4\sqrt{15}$**

### Pythagorean Identities

The **Pythagorean Identities** are fundamental equations in trigonometry derived from the Pythagorean Theorem ($x^2 + y^2 = r^2$) as applied to the unit circle. These identities allow you to find the value of one trigonometric function when another is known.
#### 1. Primary Identities
Based on your course materials, here are the three core Pythagorean identities:

* **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**
* **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$**
* **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$**
#### 2. Derivation and Logic
These formulas are built upon the definitions of trigonometric functions in terms of $x$, $y$, and $r$:
* **Sine ($\sin \theta$):** $y/r$
* **Cosine ($\cos \theta$):** $x/r$
* **Tangent ($\tan \theta$):** $y/x$

If you divide the primary identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$) by $\cos^2 \theta$, you arrive at the second identity involving tangent and secant. Similarly, dividing by $\sin^2 \theta$ results in the third identity involving cotangent and cosecant.
#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Identity | Primary Functions Involved | Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$** | Sine, Cosine | Converting between $\sin$ and $\cos$. |
| **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$** | Tangent, Secant | Finding $\sec$ if $\tan$ is known. |
| **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$** | Cotangent, Cosecant | Finding $\csc$ if $\cot$ is known. |
### Deriving the Three Pythagorean Identities

The Pythagorean identities are derived by taking the Pythagorean theorem equation, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, and dividing each term by $r^2$, $x^2$, or $y^2$.

#### 1. Identity for $\sin$ and $\cos$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$r^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{r^2} + \frac{y^2}{r^2} = \frac{r^2}{r^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{r})^2 + (\frac{y}{r})^2 = 1$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$:
* **Result:** $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$ (or **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**)

#### 2. Identity for $\tan$ and $\sec$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$x^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{x^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{r^2}{x^2}$
* **Simplify:** $1 + (\frac{y}{x})^2 = (\frac{r}{x})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$ and $\sec \theta = \frac{r}{x}$:
* **Result:** **$1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta$**

#### 3. Identity for $\cot$ and $\csc$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$y^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{y^2} = \frac{r^2}{y^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{y})^2 + 1 = (\frac{r}{y})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$ and $\csc \theta = \frac{r}{y}$:
* **Result:** **$\cot^2 \theta + 1 = \csc^2 \theta$**
### Quotient Identities

Quotient identities express trigonometric functions as the ratio of two other trigonometric functions. In PreCalculus, there are two primary quotient identities involving tangent and cotangent.

#### 1. The Identities
* **Tangent Identity**: $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* **Cotangent Identity**: $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$

#### 2. Derivation of the Tangent Identity
To derive the tangent identity, we use the definitions of sine and cosine in terms of $x, y,$ and $r$:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Sine over Cosine:
    $$\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{y/r}{x/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify the complex fraction by multiplying by the reciprocal:
    $$\frac{y}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{x} = \frac{y}{x}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$, we conclude that **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$**.

#### 3. Derivation of the Cotangent Identity
The cotangent identity is derived similarly or by using the reciprocal property of tangent:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Cosine over Sine:
    $$\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x/r}{y/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify:
    $$\frac{x}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{y} = \frac{x}{y}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$, we conclude that **$\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$**.

#### 4. Summary for Obsidian
| Identity      | Ratio                             | Reciprocal Relationship |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Tangent**   | $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\cot \theta}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\tan \theta}$ |
### Ranges of Trigonometric Function Values

The **range** of a trigonometric function is the set of all possible output values ($y$-values). These ranges are determined by the relationships between $x, y,$ and $r$ (the radius) on the coordinate plane.

#### 1. Range of Sine and Cosine
For any point on a circle, the horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) distances can never exceed the radius ($r$).
* **Sine**: Since $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $|y| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Cosine**: Since $\cos \theta = x/r$ and $|x| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Range**: $[-1, 1]$
* **Inequality**: $-1 \leq \sin \theta \leq 1$ and $-1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1$

#### 2. Range of Cosecant and Secant
Since these are the reciprocals of sine and cosine, their values are always "outside" the $[-1, 1]$ interval. They can never be a proper fraction like $1/2$ or $-1/2$.
* **Cosecant**: $\csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta$. If $\sin \theta$ is small, $\csc \theta$ is large.
* **Secant**: $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$. If $\cos \theta$ is small, $\sec \theta$ is large.
* **Range**: $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: $\csc \theta \leq -1$ or $\csc \theta \geq 1$; $\sec \theta \leq -1$ or $\sec \theta \geq 1$

#### 3. Range of Tangent and Cotangent
Tangent and cotangent are ratios of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ can be much larger than $y$, or $y$ can be much larger than $x$, these ratios can result in any real number.
* **Tangent**: $\tan \theta = y/x$
* **Cotangent**: $\cot \theta = x/y$
* **Range**: $(-\infty, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: All real numbers.

#### 4. Range Summary Table

| Function | Range (Interval Notation) | Range (Inequality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\cot \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\sec \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
| **$\csc \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ from $\tan \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find the exact values of the remaining trigonometric functions, we analyze the given ratio and the quadrant determined by the signs of the functions.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\tan \theta = \frac{7}{3}$ (Positive). Tangent is positive in **Quadrants I and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:
* Since the ratio is $7/3$ and we are in Quadrant III, we assign the negative values:
    * **$y = -7$**
    * **$x = -3$**
* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius ($r$):
    * $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-7)^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{9 + 49}$
    * **$r = \sqrt{58}$**

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-7}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)         |
| **$x$**           | $-3$                     |
| **$y$**           | $-7$                     |
| **$r$**           | $\sqrt{58}$              |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\sec \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these exact values, we identify the quadrant based on the given signs and then calculate the missing coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = -2$ (Negative). Since $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$, cosine is also negative. Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\cot \theta > 0$ (Positive). Cotangent is positive where tangent is positive, which occurs in **Quadrants I and III**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\sec \theta = r/x$:
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = -2$, which can be written as $2/-1$.
* **Radius ($r$):** Must be positive, so **$r = 2$**.
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** Must be **$-1$**.
* **Solve for $y$:**
    * $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
    * $(-1)^2 + y^2 = 2^2$
    * $1 + y^2 = 4$
    * $y^2 = 3$
    * $y = \pm\sqrt{3}$
* **Determine Sign:** Since we are in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -\sqrt{3}$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $\tan \theta = y/x$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{-1} = \sqrt{3}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                 |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)      |
| **$x$**           | $-1$                  |
| **$y$**           | $-\sqrt{3}$           |
| **$r$**           | $2$                   |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $\sqrt{3}$            |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\cos \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these trigonometric values, we determine the quadrant based on the signs of the functions and then calculate the missing $y$-coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\cos \theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$ (Negative). Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:
* **Given:** $\cos \theta = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{3}$
* **Radius ($r$):** $r = 3$
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** $x = -2\sqrt{2}$
* **Solve for $y$ using $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:**
    * $(-2\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = 3^2$
    * $8 + y^2 = 9$
    * $y^2 = 1$
    * $y = \pm 1$
* **Determine Sign:** Since the angle is in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -1$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:

* **$\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{3}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-1}{-2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$**
    * Rationalizing the denominator: $\frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$
    * **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$**

#### Summary Table
| Component         | Value                |

## 2026-January-08 - Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles | Cofunction Identities :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h46m30s
### Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles

Trigonometric functions of acute angles ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) are defined by the ratios of the sides of a right triangle. These are often remembered using the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA**.

#### 1. Right Triangle Definitions
In a right triangle, we identify three sides relative to an acute angle $\theta$:
* **Opposite**: The side across from angle $\theta$.
* **Adjacent**: The side next to angle $\theta$ (that is not the hypotenuse).
* **Hypotenuse**: The longest side, opposite the right angle.

#### 2. The Six Trigonometric Ratios
The functions are defined as follows:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (SOH)
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (CAH)
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (TOA)

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Sine)
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (Reciprocal of Cosine)
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Tangent)

#### 3. Cofunction Identities
Acute angles in a right triangle are complementary ($\theta$ and $90^\circ - \theta$). This leads to cofunction identities where a function of an angle is equal to the cofunction of its complement:
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function      | Abbreviation | Ratio                     |
| :------------ | :----------- | :------------------------ |
| **Sine**      | $\sin$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Cosine**    | $\cos$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Tangent**   | $\tan$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cosecant**  | $\csc$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Opp}$ |
| **Secant**    | $\sec$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\cot$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Opp}$ |
### Cofunction Identities

Cofunction identities describe the relationship between trigonometric functions of complementary angles. In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary, meaning they sum to $90^\circ$ (or $\pi/2$ radians).

#### 1. The Core Concept
A trigonometric function of an acute angle $\theta$ is equal to the **cofunction** of its complement. This means the value of a function at $\theta$ is the same as the value of its "co-" partner at $90^\circ - \theta$.

#### 2. List of Cofunction Identities
These identities apply to the three pairs of cofunctions:

**Sine and Cosine**
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Tangent and Cotangent**
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Secant and Cosecant**
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\csc \theta = \sec(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 3. Derivation Logic
In a right triangle with acute angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
* $\sin \alpha = \frac{\text{Opposite to } \alpha}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* $\cos \beta = \frac{\text{Adjacent to } \beta}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
Since the side opposite to $\alpha$ is the same side that is adjacent to $\beta$, and $\beta = 90^\circ - \alpha$, it follows that $\sin \alpha = \cos(90^\circ - \alpha)$.

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function    | Cofunction | Identity (Degrees)                      |
| :---------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Sine**    | Cosine     | $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Tangent** | Cotangent  | $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Secant**  | Cosecant   | $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
### Finding the 6 Trigonometric Functions for a Right Triangle

Based on the provided right triangle image, we can find the values of the six trigonometric functions for the angle $\theta$ using the side lengths provided.

#### 1. Identify the Sides
From the triangle in the image:
* **Opposite side** (across from $\theta$): $2$
* **Adjacent side** (next to $\theta$): $4$
* **Hypotenuse** (opposite the right angle): $2\sqrt{5}$

#### 2. Calculate the 6 Functions
Using the standard ratios for a right triangle:

**Primary Functions:**
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$**

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}$**
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$**
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$**

#### 3. Summary Table
| Function | Exact Ratio | Simplified/Rationalized |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| $\sin \theta$ | $2 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\cos \theta$ | $4 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\tan \theta$ | $2 / 4$ | $1 / 2$ |
| $\csc \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 2$ | $\sqrt{5}$ |
| $\sec \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 4$ | $\sqrt{5} / 2$ |
| $\cot \theta$ | $4 / 2$ | $2$ |
### Solving for $\theta$ Using Cofunction Identities

The problem from the image asks to solve the equation:
$$\sin(2\theta + 20^\circ) = \cos(3\theta + 5^\circ)$$

#### 1. Core Concept
According to the **Cofunction Identities**, the sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Therefore, if $\sin(A) = \cos(B)$, then the sum of the two angles must be $90^\circ$:
* $A + B = 90^\circ$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Solution
Based on the equation provided in the image:
* **Identify Angles**: Let $A = 2\theta + 20^\circ$ and $B = 3\theta + 5^\circ$.
* **Set up Equation**: $(2\theta + 20^\circ) + (3\theta + 5^\circ) = 90^\circ$
* **Combine Like Terms**: $5\theta + 25^\circ = 90^\circ$
* **Isolate $\theta$ Term**: 
    * $5\theta = 90^\circ - 25^\circ$
    * $5\theta = 65^\circ$
* **Solve for $\theta$**:
    * $\theta = \frac{65^\circ}{5}$
    * **$\theta = 13^\circ$**

#### 3. Final Answer
The value of $\theta$ that satisfies the equation is **$13^\circ$**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h6m
### Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles

To find the trigonometric functions of angles that are not acute (angles outside the range $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$), we use the concepts of **Reference Angles** and the **ASTC Rule**.

#### 1. Reference Angles ($\theta'$)
A reference angle is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**.

* **Quadrant I**: $\theta' = \theta$
* **Quadrant II**: $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ (or $\pi - \theta$)
* **Quadrant III**: $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ (or $\theta - \pi$)
* **Quadrant IV**: $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ (or $2\pi - \theta$)

#### 2. Determining Signs (ASTC Rule)
The sign (positive or negative) of the function depends on the quadrant where the terminal side lies:

* **Quadrant I (All)**: All functions are **positive**.
* **Quadrant II (Students)**: **Sine** and its reciprocal **Cosecant** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant III (Take)**: **Tangent** and its reciprocal **Cotangent** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant IV (Calculus)**: **Cosine** and its reciprocal **Secant** are **positive**.

#### 3. Procedure for Evaluation
To evaluate a trigonometric function for any non-acute angle:
1.  **Find the reference angle** ($\theta'$).
2.  **Determine the sign** based on the original angle's quadrant.
3.  **Evaluate the function** for the reference angle and apply the sign.
    * Example: $\cos(210^\circ)$
    * $\theta' = 210^\circ - 180^\circ = 30^\circ$
    * $210^\circ$ is in QIII, so Cosine is negative.
    * $\cos(210^\circ) = -\cos(30^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

| Quadrant | Reference Angle                | Positive Functions |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **I**    | $\theta' = \theta$             | All                |
| **II**   | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ | $\sin, \csc$       |
| **III**  | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ | $\tan, \cot$       |
| **IV**   | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ | $\cos, \sec$       |
### Reference Angles ($\theta'$)

A **reference angle** is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**. Reference angles allow us to simplify the evaluation of trigonometric functions for any non-acute angle by relating them back to angles in the first quadrant.

#### 1. Key Characteristics
* **Always Acute**: The value is always between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ ($0$ and $\pi/2$ radians).
* **Always Positive**: Reference angles are absolute measures of rotation from the x-axis.
* **X-Axis Only**: They are never measured from the y-axis.

#### 2. Calculating Reference Angles by Quadrant
The formula used to find the reference angle ($\theta'$) depends on the quadrant in which the terminal side of the original angle ($\theta$) lies:

| Quadrant | Location of $\theta$ | Reference Angle Formula ($\theta'$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quadrant I** | $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta$ |
| **Quadrant II** | $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$ | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ |
| **Quadrant III** | $180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ |
| **Quadrant IV** | $270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$ | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ |

#### 3. Steps to Find a Reference Angle
1.  **Identify the Quadrant**: Determine where the terminal side of the angle $\theta$ sits.
2.  **Adjust for Coterminality**: If the angle is greater than $360^\circ$ or less than $0^\circ$, find a coterminal angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ first.
3.  **Apply Formula**: Use the quadrant-specific subtraction rule shown above.

#### 4. Examples
* **Example 1 ($150^\circ$)**: Lies in QII. $\theta' = 180^\circ - 150^\circ = \mathbf{30^\circ}$.
* **Example 2 ($225^\circ$)**: Lies in QIII. $\theta' = 225^\circ - 180^\circ = \mathbf{45^\circ}$.
* **Example 3 ($-60^\circ$)**: Coterminal with $300^\circ$ (QIV). $\theta' = 360^\circ - 300^\circ = \mathbf{60^\circ}$.
### Trigonometric Function Values of Special Angles

### Using Reference Angles to Find Trigonometric Values

The "use case" of a reference angle is that it allows us to create a right triangle (often called a **reference triangle**) in any quadrant. Even though $150^\circ$ is too "wide" to fit inside a right triangle, its reference angle of $30^\circ$ fits perfectly.

#### 1. Visualizing the Reference Triangle
When you draw an angle of $150^\circ$ in standard position, the terminal side sits in **Quadrant II**. To create a triangle:
1.  Drop a perpendicular line from any point on the terminal side down to the **x-axis**.
2.  The "gap" between that terminal side and the negative x-axis is your reference angle ($180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$).
3.  This forms a right triangle where the horizontal leg is on the x-axis and the vertical leg is the height.
#### 2. Assigning Values to the Triangle
Since the reference angle is $30^\circ$, we use the side ratios of a standard **30-60-90 triangle** ($1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$). However, we must apply the correct signs based on the quadrant:
* **Opposite ($y$):** $1$ (Positive, because it goes up in QII)
* **Adjacent ($x$):** $-\sqrt{3}$ (Negative, because it goes left in QII)
* **Hypotenuse ($r$):** $2$ (Always positive)

#### 3. Calculating the Values for $150^\circ$
Now, you simply use the ratios from this "drawn" triangle. The trig values for $150^\circ$ are identical to the values for $30^\circ$, just with the signs adjusted for Quadrant II:

* **$\sin(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{1}{2}$** (Positive in QII)
* **$\cos(150^\circ) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$** (Negative in QII)
* **$\tan(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$** (Negative in QII)

#### 4. Why Use the Reference Angle?
The reference angle is a shortcut. Instead of memorizing every single angle on the unit circle, you only need to know the values for $30^\circ, 45^\circ,$ and $60^\circ$. 

**The Rule:**
$$\text{Trig Function}(\theta) = \pm \text{Trig Function}(\theta')$$
You find the value using the acute reference angle ($\theta'$), and then you use the **ASTC rule** to decide if the result should be positive or negative based on the original angle's quadrant.
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = -250^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for a negative angle, we first find its positive coterminal equivalent between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ and then apply the quadrant-specific formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Add $360^\circ$ to the negative angle to find its position in standard position:
* $-250^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{110^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant II**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant II, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$:
* $\theta' = 180^\circ - 110^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 70^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $-250^\circ$   |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $110^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | II             |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$70^\circ$** |
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = 560^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for an angle greater than $360^\circ$, we first find its coterminal equivalent within one full rotation and then apply the appropriate quadrant formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from the original angle to find its position within the first rotation ($0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$):
* $560^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{200^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $180^\circ < 200^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant III, the formula is $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$:
* $\theta' = 200^\circ - 180^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 20^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $560^\circ$    |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $200^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | III            |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$20^\circ$** |
### Evaluating $\cos(-600^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To evaluate the trigonometric value of an angle outside the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range, we follow a three-step process: find a coterminal angle, determine the reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on the quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
First, we add multiples of $360^\circ$ to $-600^\circ$ to find an equivalent angle within the first positive rotation:
* $-600^\circ + 360^\circ = -240^\circ$
* $-240^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{120^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $120^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 120^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 60^\circ$**

#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: According to the ASTC rule, **Cosine is negative** in Quadrant II.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\cos(-600^\circ) = \cos(120^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\cos(60^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step                 | Value                   |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Original Angle**   | $-600^\circ$            |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $120^\circ$             |
| **Quadrant**         | II (Cosine is negative) |
| **Reference Angle**  | $60^\circ$              |
| **Final Value**      | **$-1/2$**              |
### Evaluating $\sec(495^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To find the exact value of $\sec(495^\circ)$, we simplify the angle into the first rotation, find its reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on its quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from $495^\circ$ to find the equivalent angle within the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range:
* $495^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{135^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $135^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 135^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 45^\circ$**



#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: In Quadrant II, only Sine and Cosecant are positive. Therefore, **Secant is negative**.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its reciprocal $\sec(45^\circ) = \sqrt{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\sec(495^\circ) = \sec(135^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sec(45^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sqrt{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Original Angle** | $495^\circ$ |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $135^\circ$ |
| **Quadrant** | II (Secant is negative) |
| **Reference Angle** | $45^\circ$ |
| **Final Value** | **$-\sqrt{2}$** |
