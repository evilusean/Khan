https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY
- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
- **Right Angle** : Exactly 90 Degrees
- **Obtuse Angle** : Greater than 90 degrees, less than 180 degrees
- **Straight Angle** : 180 degrees
- **Complementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 90 degrees, they are *complementary*
- **Supplementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 180 degrees, they are *supplementary*
## 2026-January-04 - Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=12m10s
- $1\degree$ = $\frac{1}{360}$ : 360 degrees in a circle 
- What happens when you need to measure a rotation that is less than a degree? *Minutes*, and *seconds* are portions/fractions of a degree.
- $125^\circ 30' 45''$ : Standard Notation for *Degrees $\degree$*, *Minutes $'$*, *Seconds $''$* 
- $60'$ = $\frac{1\degree}{60}$ : $60'$ minutes in one degree ($1\degree$)
- $60''$ = $\frac{1'}{60}$ : $60''$ seconds in one minute($1'$)
- $1'' = \frac{1'}{60} = \frac{1\degree}{3600}$ : 1 second is 1/3600th (60 * 60) of a degree
- $37^\circ 15' 45''$ + $19^\circ 50' 17''$  = $57^\circ 6' 2''$ : Once you understand it, you just need to know the carrying process (every 60 seconds is a minute, every 60 minutes is a degree)
- $14^\circ 18' 30''$ - $9^\circ 25' 50''$ = $4\degree 52' 40''$ 
- To find the complement(what adds up to 90 degrees), just borrow from the degrees for the minutes, and borrow from those new minutes for the seconds
- $114.09\degree$ = $114\degree 5' 24''$ : How to go from Decimal form to degrees, minutes and seconds. simply multiply the fractional degree (in this case, '0.09' = 5.4) by 60, then take whatever fractional part is remaining('0.4' * 60 = 24) and multiply that by 60 again for the seconds 
- If you have a TI 83 / 84 : type the number(fractional degrees)  into the calculator look for the **Angle** button, then press **DMS** button and it will convert it for you
- To convert from degrees minutes seconds to a fractional degree, simply divide the *seconds $'$* by '60' and the *minutes* by '3600' then add that to your degrees
## 2026-January-04 - Angles in Standard Position and Coterminal Angles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=24m55s
### Trigonometry: Angles in Standard Position & Coterminal Angles

#### 1. Angles in Standard Position
An angle is in **standard position** when its vertex is at the origin $(0,0)$ of the Cartesian plane and its **initial side** lies along the positive x-axis.

* **Positive Angles:** Measured **counterclockwise** from the initial side.
* **Negative Angles:** Measured **clockwise** from the initial side.
* **Terminal Side:** The ray where the angle measurement ends.
* **Quadrantal Angles:** Angles whose terminal sides lie exactly on an axis ($0^\circ, 90^\circ, 180^\circ, 270^\circ$, etc.).

#### 2. Coterminal Angles
Coterminal angles are angles in standard position that share the same **terminal side**. Although they look the same on a graph, they have different measures because they differ by one or more full rotations.

**Finding Coterminal Angles:**
To find an angle coterminal to a given angle $\theta$, add or subtract multiples of $360^\circ$ (for degrees) or $2\pi$ (for radians).

* **Degrees:** $\theta \pm 360^\circ n$
* **Radians:** $\theta \pm 2\pi n$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Term | Definition | Formula / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Side** | Starting ray of the angle | Always the positive x-axis. |
| **Terminal Side** | Ending ray of the angle | Determines the quadrant. |
| **Positive Angle** | Counterclockwise rotation | Example: $+120^\circ$ |
| **Negative Angle** | Clockwise rotation | Example: $-45^\circ$ |
| **Coterminal** | Different measures, same terminal side | Add/Subtract $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$. |

#### 4. Practice Examples
* **Find a positive coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ + 360^\circ = 405^\circ$
* **Find a negative coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ - 360^\circ = -315^\circ$
* **Find the smallest positive coterminal angle for $\frac{13\pi}{4}$:**
    $\frac{13\pi}{4} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$
## 2026-January-05 - Angles Relationship and Similar Triangles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=34m30s
### Vertical Angles :
- **Vertical Angles** : Angles that are opposite eachother where the 2 lines cross - The opposite side angles will be the same equal measures
![[Pasted image 20260105142242.png]]
- 1 and 3 are opposites and will be the same
- 2 and 4 are opposites and will be the same
- 1 and 2 are supplementary angles and will add up to 180 degrees
- 3 and 4 are supplementary as well and will also add up to 180 degrees
### Transversal intersects 2 parallel Lines : 
![[Pasted image 20260105142125.png]]
- **Interior Angles** Are the angles on the interior of the parallel lines
- **Alternate Interior Angles** : are angles that will have equal measures (3 and 6, 5 and 4)
- 3 and 6 will be the equal angle measurements
- 4 and 5 will be the equal angle measurements
- **Exterior Angles** : Are the angles outside the interior parallel lines
- **Alternate Exterior Angles** : Alternate Exterior Angles will have exterior measures (1 and 8, 2 and 7)
- 2 and 7 will be the equal angle measurements
- 1 and 8 will be the equal angle measurements
- Since 7 and 8 are supplementary angles(add up to 180), and 2 = 7 : 
  7 :$(11x-53)\degree$
  8 : $(4x+8)\degree$ 
  7+ 8 : $11x -53 +4x + 8 = 180\degree$
  15x - 45 = 180
  15x = 225
  x = 15 
  Plug x into the angles to get their measurement 
  2 and 7 :  $(11x-53)\degree$ : 11(15) - 53 : 165 - 53 : $112\degree$
  1 and 8 :  $(4x+8)\degree$ : 4(15) + 8 : $68\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so : 7, 6, 2, 3 = $112\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so 1, 4, 5 , 8 = $68\degree$ 
### Triangle Sum 180
![[Pasted image 20260105144919.png]]
- The sum of the measure of any triangle will always be 180 degrees
- 6x + 1 + 10x - 56 + 43 = 180 : 16x -12 = 180 : 16x  = 192 : x = 12
- Plug 12 into x for the other 2 angles :
  1: 6(12) + 1 : $73\degree$ 
  2: 10(12) - 56 : $64\degree$ 
  3 : $43\degree$ 
  Check : $73\degree + 64\degree + 43\degree = 180\degree$ 
### Similar Triangles :
![[Pasted image 20260105145810.png]]
- Similar Triangles Must have the same measure of angles 
- corresponding angles must have same measures
- So A = D, F = C, E = B
  A and  D = $18\degree$ 
  F and C = $144\degree$ 
  All triangles add up to 180 degrees :
  B and E = $180\degree - 144\degree - 18\degree = 18\degree$
### Similar Triangles, Missing Side Lengths :
![[Pasted image 20260105150638.png]]
- Since the length of side BA and ED are the same angles, and the length is 15 on BA and 30 on ED (doubled) the similar triangles are just double the size for triangle EDF, so just double the size of the sides :
  $\triangle ABC$ ~  $\triangle DEF$ : Triangle ABC is similar(~) to Triangle DEF
  BA = 15 :   ED = 30
  AC = 24 :   DF = 48
  BC = 30.5 :   EF = 61
- For similar triangles : Corresponding Sides must be equal, and corresponding sides must be *proportional*
## 2026-January-05 - Trigonometric Functions :

### Trigonometric Values for the Point $(9, -9)$

To find the six trigonometric functions for the point $(x, y) = (9, -9)$, we first determine the distance from the origin $r$.

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
Using the distance formula simplified for the origin:

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
* $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{9 + 9}$
* $r = \sqrt{18}$
* $r = 3\sqrt{2}$

#### The Six Trigonometric Functions

## 2026-January-06 - Reciprocal Identities, Signs of Trigonometric Function Values, Finding Missing Function Values :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h5m30s
- **SOH-CAH-TOA** (Sine=Opposite(y) over Hypoteneuse(r), Cosine = Adjacent(x) over Hypoteneuse(r), Tangent = Opposite(y) over Adjacent(x))
- **Recipricoals** : Sine+Cosecant(S with C) - Cosine+Secant(C with S) - Tangent+CoTangent (Tan with Tan)
- If you know one(like sine), you automatically know the other(its reciprocal, Cosecant) by simply flipping the fraction.
- 
### Why To use Trig Functions? Practical Use? 
- You know **one angle** (besides the 90°) and **one side** → find everything else.
- You know **two sides** → find all angles and the remaining side.
In a **right triangle**, you always have one 90° angle. To determine the entire triangle (all sides and both acute angles), you need **any two** of the following three pieces:
1. One acute angle + one side (any side)
2. Two sides (any two of the three sides)
Key rule: In a right triangle, any 2 pieces (excluding knowing just the right angle) are enough to find everything else.
### Trig Functions with Reciprocals :
- **sin θ** = y / r  → 
  **csc θ** = r / y (y ≠ 0)
- **cos θ** = x / r → 
  **sec θ** = r / x (x ≠ 0)
- **tan θ** = y / x (x ≠ 0) → 
  **cot θ** = x / y (y ≠ 0)
### Reciprocal Identities

These identities define the relationship between the primary trigonometric functions and their reciprocal counterparts.

* $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}$
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$
* $\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta}$
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$
* $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$

#### Quotient Identities
In addition to the reciprocal values, these functions can be expressed as ratios of sine and cosine:

* $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant
![[Pasted image 20260106151753.png]]
The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$.

#### 1. Quadrant Sign Analysis
The signs are derived from the coordinates in each quadrant, where $r$ (the radius) is always positive:
* **Quadrant I:** $x > 0, y > 0$. All ratios are positive.
* **Quadrant II:** $x < 0, y > 0$. Only $\sin \theta$ and $\csc \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant III:** $x < 0, y < 0$. Only $\tan \theta$ and $\cot \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant IV:** $x > 0, y < 0$. Only $\cos \theta$ and $\sec \theta$ are positive.

#### 2. Trigonometric Sign Table
| Quadrant | $\sin \theta$ | $\cos \theta$ | $\tan \theta$ | $\cot \theta$ | $\sec \theta$ | $\csc \theta$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **I** | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **III** | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **IV** | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Definitions of the 6 Functions
The signs in the table above are based on these fundamental ratios:
* $\sin \theta = y/r$
* $\cos \theta = x/r$
* $\tan \theta = y/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\csc \theta = r/y, (y \neq 0)$
* $\sec \theta = r/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\cot \theta = x/y, (y \neq 0)$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant

The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$. 

* **$x$ is positive** in Quadrants I and IV.
* **$y$ is positive** in Quadrants I and II.
* **$r$ (radius)** is always positive.

#### 1. The "All Students Take Calculus" Mnemonic
A common way to remember which functions are **positive** in each quadrant:
* **A**ll (Quadrant I): **A**ll functions are positive.
* **S**tudents (Quadrant II): **S**ine (and cosecant) are positive.
* **T**ake (Quadrant III): **T**angent (and cotangent) are positive.
* **C**alculus (Quadrant IV): **C**osine (and secant) are positive.

#### 2. Quadrant Sign Table

| Quadrant | $\sin$ / $\csc$ ($y$) | $\cos$ / $\sec$ ($x$) | $\tan$ / $\cot$ ($y/x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** ($90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$) | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **III** ($180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$) | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **IV** ($270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$) | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Detailed Breakdown
* **Quadrant I (All $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are positive. Every ratio is positive.
* **Quadrant II (Sine $+$):** $y$ is positive, but $x$ is negative. Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, it remains positive. $\cos \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $x$, so they are negative.
* **Quadrant III (Tangent $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are negative. $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ are negative, but $\tan \theta = y/x$ becomes positive (negative divided by negative).
* **Quadrant IV (Cosine $+$):** $x$ is positive, but $y$ is negative. Since $\cos \theta = x/r$, it remains positive. $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $y$, so they are negative.

### Solving for Cosine using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the secant function, we can find the cosine value using the reciprocal relationship between the two.

#### Given

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$



#### Solution
1. Substitute the given value into the formula:
   $$\cos \theta = \frac{1}{9/2}$$
2. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
   $$\cos \theta = 1 \cdot \frac{2}{9}$$
3. Result:
   **$\cos \theta = \frac{2}{9}$**

#### Quick Reference
| Known Function              | Reciprocal                  | Method            |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| $\sec \theta = \frac{a}{b}$ | $\cos \theta = \frac{b}{a}$ | Flip the fraction |
### Solving for Cosecant using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the sine function, we can find the cosecant value using their reciprocal relationship.

#### Given
* $\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$

#### Solution
1. **Substitute the given value:**
   $$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}}$$

2. **Multiply by the reciprocal:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{6}}$$

3. **Rationalize the denominator:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{6}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{6}}{6}$$

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**

#### Quick Summary
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$**
* **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**
### Determining Quadrants using ASTC

To find the quadrant where $\cos \theta > 0$ and $\csc \theta < 0$, we analyze the signs of the trigonometric functions based on the **All Students Take Calculus** mnemonic.

#### 1. Analyze the Given Conditions
* **Condition 1: $\cos \theta > 0$ (Positive)**
    * According to **ASTC**, Cosine is positive in **Quadrant I** (All) and **Quadrant IV** (Calculus).
* **Condition 2: $\csc \theta < 0$ (Negative)**
    * Since $\csc \theta$ is the reciprocal of $\sin \theta$, it has the same sign as sine. 
    * Sine is positive in Quadrants I and II, so it is **negative** in **Quadrant III** and **Quadrant IV**.

#### 2. Find the Overlap
To satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we look for the quadrant common to both lists:
* $\cos \theta$ is positive in: {I, **IV**}
* $\csc \theta$ is negative in: {III, **IV**}

**Result:** The angle $\theta$ must lie in **Quadrant IV**.

#### 3. Quick Reference Summary
| Function Sign                             | Possible Quadrants |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| $\cos \theta > 0$                         | I, IV              |
| $\sin \theta < 0$ (same as $\csc \theta$) | III, IV            |
| **Intersection**                          | **Quadrant IV**    |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = 110^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for $110^\circ$, we first locate which quadrant the angle falls into and then apply the **ASTC (All Students Take Calculus)** rule.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Angle:** $110^\circ$
* **Boundary:** Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant II**.
#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant II** ("Students"):
* **Sine ($\sin$)** and its reciprocal **Cosecant ($\csc$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $110^\circ$

| $\cot 110^\circ$ | **$-$** | $x/y$ (Negative / Positive) |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = -150^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for a negative angle, we first find its position on the coordinate plane or identify its positive coterminal equivalent.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Rotation:** Starting from the positive x-axis, rotate **clockwise** $150^\circ$.
* **Coterminal Angle:** $-150^\circ + 360^\circ = 210^\circ$.
* **Boundary:** Since $180^\circ < 210^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant III** ("Take"):
* **Tangent ($\tan$)** and its reciprocal **Cotangent ($\cot$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** (Sine, Cosine, Cosecant, Secant) are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $-150^\circ$

### Determining Trigonometric Components for $\sec \theta = 19/11$ and $\sin \theta < 0$

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
To determine the quadrant, we analyze the signs of the given functions:
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$ (Positive). Since $\sec \theta = r/x$, $x$ must be positive. This occurs in **Quadrants I and IV**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, $y$ must be negative. This occurs in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side is located in **Quadrant IV**.


#### 2. Solve for $r$ and $x$
Using the definition of the secant function from the provided image:
* **Formula:** $\sec \theta = r/x$
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$
* **Identification:** * $r = 19$
    * $x = 11$

#### 3. Solve for $y$
Using the Pythagorean relationship $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:
* $11^2 + y^2 = 19^2$
* $121 + y^2 = 361$
* $y^2 = 361 - 121$
* $y^2 = 240$
* $y = \pm\sqrt{240} = \pm 4\sqrt{15}$

**Final Value for $y$:** Because the angle is in **Quadrant IV**, $y$ must be negative:
* **$y = -4\sqrt{15}$**

### Pythagorean Identities

The **Pythagorean Identities** are fundamental equations in trigonometry derived from the Pythagorean Theorem ($x^2 + y^2 = r^2$) as applied to the unit circle. These identities allow you to find the value of one trigonometric function when another is known.
#### 1. Primary Identities
Based on your course materials, here are the three core Pythagorean identities:

* **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**
* **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$**
* **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$**
#### 2. Derivation and Logic
These formulas are built upon the definitions of trigonometric functions in terms of $x$, $y$, and $r$:
* **Sine ($\sin \theta$):** $y/r$
* **Cosine ($\cos \theta$):** $x/r$
* **Tangent ($\tan \theta$):** $y/x$

If you divide the primary identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$) by $\cos^2 \theta$, you arrive at the second identity involving tangent and secant. Similarly, dividing by $\sin^2 \theta$ results in the third identity involving cotangent and cosecant.
#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Identity | Primary Functions Involved | Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$** | Sine, Cosine | Converting between $\sin$ and $\cos$. |
| **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$** | Tangent, Secant | Finding $\sec$ if $\tan$ is known. |
| **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$** | Cotangent, Cosecant | Finding $\csc$ if $\cot$ is known. |
### Deriving the Three Pythagorean Identities

The Pythagorean identities are derived by taking the Pythagorean theorem equation, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, and dividing each term by $r^2$, $x^2$, or $y^2$.

#### 1. Identity for $\sin$ and $\cos$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$r^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{r^2} + \frac{y^2}{r^2} = \frac{r^2}{r^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{r})^2 + (\frac{y}{r})^2 = 1$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$:
* **Result:** $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$ (or **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**)

#### 2. Identity for $\tan$ and $\sec$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$x^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{x^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{r^2}{x^2}$
* **Simplify:** $1 + (\frac{y}{x})^2 = (\frac{r}{x})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$ and $\sec \theta = \frac{r}{x}$:
* **Result:** **$1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta$**

#### 3. Identity for $\cot$ and $\csc$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$y^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{y^2} = \frac{r^2}{y^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{y})^2 + 1 = (\frac{r}{y})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$ and $\csc \theta = \frac{r}{y}$:
* **Result:** **$\cot^2 \theta + 1 = \csc^2 \theta$**
### Quotient Identities

Quotient identities express trigonometric functions as the ratio of two other trigonometric functions. In PreCalculus, there are two primary quotient identities involving tangent and cotangent.

#### 1. The Identities
* **Tangent Identity**: $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* **Cotangent Identity**: $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$

#### 2. Derivation of the Tangent Identity
To derive the tangent identity, we use the definitions of sine and cosine in terms of $x, y,$ and $r$:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Sine over Cosine:
    $$\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{y/r}{x/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify the complex fraction by multiplying by the reciprocal:
    $$\frac{y}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{x} = \frac{y}{x}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$, we conclude that **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$**.

#### 3. Derivation of the Cotangent Identity
The cotangent identity is derived similarly or by using the reciprocal property of tangent:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Cosine over Sine:
    $$\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x/r}{y/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify:
    $$\frac{x}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{y} = \frac{x}{y}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$, we conclude that **$\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$**.

#### 4. Summary for Obsidian
| Identity      | Ratio                             | Reciprocal Relationship |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Tangent**   | $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\cot \theta}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\tan \theta}$ |
### Ranges of Trigonometric Function Values

The **range** of a trigonometric function is the set of all possible output values ($y$-values). These ranges are determined by the relationships between $x, y,$ and $r$ (the radius) on the coordinate plane.

#### 1. Range of Sine and Cosine
For any point on a circle, the horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) distances can never exceed the radius ($r$).
* **Sine**: Since $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $|y| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Cosine**: Since $\cos \theta = x/r$ and $|x| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Range**: $[-1, 1]$
* **Inequality**: $-1 \leq \sin \theta \leq 1$ and $-1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1$

#### 2. Range of Cosecant and Secant
Since these are the reciprocals of sine and cosine, their values are always "outside" the $[-1, 1]$ interval. They can never be a proper fraction like $1/2$ or $-1/2$.
* **Cosecant**: $\csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta$. If $\sin \theta$ is small, $\csc \theta$ is large.
* **Secant**: $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$. If $\cos \theta$ is small, $\sec \theta$ is large.
* **Range**: $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: $\csc \theta \leq -1$ or $\csc \theta \geq 1$; $\sec \theta \leq -1$ or $\sec \theta \geq 1$

#### 3. Range of Tangent and Cotangent
Tangent and cotangent are ratios of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ can be much larger than $y$, or $y$ can be much larger than $x$, these ratios can result in any real number.
* **Tangent**: $\tan \theta = y/x$
* **Cotangent**: $\cot \theta = x/y$
* **Range**: $(-\infty, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: All real numbers.

#### 4. Range Summary Table

| Function | Range (Interval Notation) | Range (Inequality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\cot \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\sec \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
| **$\csc \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ from $\tan \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find the exact values of the remaining trigonometric functions, we analyze the given ratio and the quadrant determined by the signs of the functions.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\tan \theta = \frac{7}{3}$ (Positive). Tangent is positive in **Quadrants I and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:
* Since the ratio is $7/3$ and we are in Quadrant III, we assign the negative values:
    * **$y = -7$**
    * **$x = -3$**
* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius ($r$):
    * $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-7)^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{9 + 49}$
    * **$r = \sqrt{58}$**

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-7}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)         |
| **$x$**           | $-3$                     |
| **$y$**           | $-7$                     |
| **$r$**           | $\sqrt{58}$              |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\sec \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these exact values, we identify the quadrant based on the given signs and then calculate the missing coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = -2$ (Negative). Since $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$, cosine is also negative. Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\cot \theta > 0$ (Positive). Cotangent is positive where tangent is positive, which occurs in **Quadrants I and III**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\sec \theta = r/x$:
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = -2$, which can be written as $2/-1$.
* **Radius ($r$):** Must be positive, so **$r = 2$**.
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** Must be **$-1$**.
* **Solve for $y$:**
    * $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
    * $(-1)^2 + y^2 = 2^2$
    * $1 + y^2 = 4$
    * $y^2 = 3$
    * $y = \pm\sqrt{3}$
* **Determine Sign:** Since we are in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -\sqrt{3}$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $\tan \theta = y/x$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{-1} = \sqrt{3}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                 |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)      |
| **$x$**           | $-1$                  |
| **$y$**           | $-\sqrt{3}$           |
| **$r$**           | $2$                   |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $\sqrt{3}$            |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\cos \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these trigonometric values, we determine the quadrant based on the signs of the functions and then calculate the missing $y$-coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\cos \theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$ (Negative). Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:
* **Given:** $\cos \theta = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{3}$
* **Radius ($r$):** $r = 3$
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** $x = -2\sqrt{2}$
* **Solve for $y$ using $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:**
    * $(-2\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = 3^2$
    * $8 + y^2 = 9$
    * $y^2 = 1$
    * $y = \pm 1$
* **Determine Sign:** Since the angle is in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -1$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:

* **$\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{3}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-1}{-2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$**
    * Rationalizing the denominator: $\frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$
    * **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$**

#### Summary Table
| Component         | Value                |

## 2026-January-08 - Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles | Cofunction Identities :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h46m30s
### Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles

Trigonometric functions of acute angles ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) are defined by the ratios of the sides of a right triangle. These are often remembered using the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA**.

#### 1. Right Triangle Definitions
In a right triangle, we identify three sides relative to an acute angle $\theta$:
* **Opposite**: The side across from angle $\theta$.
* **Adjacent**: The side next to angle $\theta$ (that is not the hypotenuse).
* **Hypotenuse**: The longest side, opposite the right angle.

#### 2. The Six Trigonometric Ratios
The functions are defined as follows:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (SOH)
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (CAH)
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (TOA)

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Sine)
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (Reciprocal of Cosine)
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Tangent)

#### 3. Cofunction Identities
Acute angles in a right triangle are complementary ($\theta$ and $90^\circ - \theta$). This leads to cofunction identities where a function of an angle is equal to the cofunction of its complement:
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function      | Abbreviation | Ratio                     |
| :------------ | :----------- | :------------------------ |
| **Sine**      | $\sin$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Cosine**    | $\cos$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Tangent**   | $\tan$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cosecant**  | $\csc$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Opp}$ |
| **Secant**    | $\sec$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\cot$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Opp}$ |
### Cofunction Identities

Cofunction identities describe the relationship between trigonometric functions of complementary angles. In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary, meaning they sum to $90^\circ$ (or $\pi/2$ radians).

#### 1. The Core Concept
A trigonometric function of an acute angle $\theta$ is equal to the **cofunction** of its complement. This means the value of a function at $\theta$ is the same as the value of its "co-" partner at $90^\circ - \theta$.

#### 2. List of Cofunction Identities
These identities apply to the three pairs of cofunctions:

**Sine and Cosine**
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Tangent and Cotangent**
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Secant and Cosecant**
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\csc \theta = \sec(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 3. Derivation Logic
In a right triangle with acute angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
* $\sin \alpha = \frac{\text{Opposite to } \alpha}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* $\cos \beta = \frac{\text{Adjacent to } \beta}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
Since the side opposite to $\alpha$ is the same side that is adjacent to $\beta$, and $\beta = 90^\circ - \alpha$, it follows that $\sin \alpha = \cos(90^\circ - \alpha)$.

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function    | Cofunction | Identity (Degrees)                      |
| :---------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Sine**    | Cosine     | $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Tangent** | Cotangent  | $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Secant**  | Cosecant   | $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
### Finding the 6 Trigonometric Functions for a Right Triangle

Based on the provided right triangle image, we can find the values of the six trigonometric functions for the angle $\theta$ using the side lengths provided.

#### 1. Identify the Sides
From the triangle in the image:
* **Opposite side** (across from $\theta$): $2$
* **Adjacent side** (next to $\theta$): $4$
* **Hypotenuse** (opposite the right angle): $2\sqrt{5}$

#### 2. Calculate the 6 Functions
Using the standard ratios for a right triangle:

**Primary Functions:**
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$**

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}$**
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$**
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$**

#### 3. Summary Table
| Function | Exact Ratio | Simplified/Rationalized |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| $\sin \theta$ | $2 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\cos \theta$ | $4 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\tan \theta$ | $2 / 4$ | $1 / 2$ |
| $\csc \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 2$ | $\sqrt{5}$ |
| $\sec \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 4$ | $\sqrt{5} / 2$ |
| $\cot \theta$ | $4 / 2$ | $2$ |
### Solving for $\theta$ Using Cofunction Identities

The problem from the image asks to solve the equation:
$$\sin(2\theta + 20^\circ) = \cos(3\theta + 5^\circ)$$

#### 1. Core Concept
According to the **Cofunction Identities**, the sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Therefore, if $\sin(A) = \cos(B)$, then the sum of the two angles must be $90^\circ$:
* $A + B = 90^\circ$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Solution
Based on the equation provided in the image:
* **Identify Angles**: Let $A = 2\theta + 20^\circ$ and $B = 3\theta + 5^\circ$.
* **Set up Equation**: $(2\theta + 20^\circ) + (3\theta + 5^\circ) = 90^\circ$
* **Combine Like Terms**: $5\theta + 25^\circ = 90^\circ$
* **Isolate $\theta$ Term**: 
    * $5\theta = 90^\circ - 25^\circ$
    * $5\theta = 65^\circ$
* **Solve for $\theta$**:
    * $\theta = \frac{65^\circ}{5}$
    * **$\theta = 13^\circ$**

#### 3. Final Answer
The value of $\theta$ that satisfies the equation is **$13^\circ$**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h6m
### Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles

To find the trigonometric functions of angles that are not acute (angles outside the range $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$), we use the concepts of **Reference Angles** and the **ASTC Rule**.

#### 1. Reference Angles ($\theta'$)
A reference angle is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**.

* **Quadrant I**: $\theta' = \theta$
* **Quadrant II**: $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ (or $\pi - \theta$)
* **Quadrant III**: $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ (or $\theta - \pi$)
* **Quadrant IV**: $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ (or $2\pi - \theta$)

#### 2. Determining Signs (ASTC Rule)
The sign (positive or negative) of the function depends on the quadrant where the terminal side lies:

* **Quadrant I (All)**: All functions are **positive**.
* **Quadrant II (Students)**: **Sine** and its reciprocal **Cosecant** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant III (Take)**: **Tangent** and its reciprocal **Cotangent** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant IV (Calculus)**: **Cosine** and its reciprocal **Secant** are **positive**.

#### 3. Procedure for Evaluation
To evaluate a trigonometric function for any non-acute angle:
1.  **Find the reference angle** ($\theta'$).
2.  **Determine the sign** based on the original angle's quadrant.
3.  **Evaluate the function** for the reference angle and apply the sign.
    * Example: $\cos(210^\circ)$
    * $\theta' = 210^\circ - 180^\circ = 30^\circ$
    * $210^\circ$ is in QIII, so Cosine is negative.
    * $\cos(210^\circ) = -\cos(30^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

#### 4. Summary Table
| Quadrant | Reference Angle                | Positive Functions |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **I**    | $\theta' = \theta$             | All                |
| **II**   | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ | $\sin, \csc$       |
| **III**  | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ | $\tan, \cot$       |
| **IV**   | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ | $\cos, \sec$       |
### Reference Angles ($\theta'$)

A **reference angle** is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**. Reference angles allow us to simplify the evaluation of trigonometric functions for any non-acute angle by relating them back to angles in the first quadrant.

#### 1. Key Characteristics
* **Always Acute**: The value is always between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ ($0$ and $\pi/2$ radians).
* **Always Positive**: Reference angles are absolute measures of rotation from the x-axis.
* **X-Axis Only**: They are never measured from the y-axis.

#### 2. Calculating Reference Angles by Quadrant
The formula used to find the reference angle ($\theta'$) depends on the quadrant in which the terminal side of the original angle ($\theta$) lies:

| Quadrant | Location of $\theta$ | Reference Angle Formula ($\theta'$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quadrant I** | $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta$ |
| **Quadrant II** | $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$ | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ |
| **Quadrant III** | $180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ |
| **Quadrant IV** | $270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$ | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ |

#### 3. Steps to Find a Reference Angle
1.  **Identify the Quadrant**: Determine where the terminal side of the angle $\theta$ sits.
2.  **Adjust for Coterminality**: If the angle is greater than $360^\circ$ or less than $0^\circ$, find a coterminal angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ first.
3.  **Apply Formula**: Use the quadrant-specific subtraction rule shown above.

#### 4. Examples
* **Example 1 ($150^\circ$)**: Lies in QII. $\theta' = 180^\circ - 150^\circ = \mathbf{30^\circ}$.
* **Example 2 ($225^\circ$)**: Lies in QIII. $\theta' = 225^\circ - 180^\circ = \mathbf{45^\circ}$.
* **Example 3 ($-60^\circ$)**: Coterminal with $300^\circ$ (QIV). $\theta' = 360^\circ - 300^\circ = \mathbf{60^\circ}$.
### Trigonometric Function Values of Special Angles

Special angles—$30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$—are derived from two specific right triangles: the **45-45-90** triangle and the **30-60-90** triangle. These triangles provide exact values for trigonometric functions that are used throughout Calculus and Physics.

### Using Reference Angles to Find Trigonometric Values

The "use case" of a reference angle is that it allows us to create a right triangle (often called a **reference triangle**) in any quadrant. Even though $150^\circ$ is too "wide" to fit inside a right triangle, its reference angle of $30^\circ$ fits perfectly.

#### 1. Visualizing the Reference Triangle
When you draw an angle of $150^\circ$ in standard position, the terminal side sits in **Quadrant II**. To create a triangle:
1.  Drop a perpendicular line from any point on the terminal side down to the **x-axis**.
2.  The "gap" between that terminal side and the negative x-axis is your reference angle ($180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$).
3.  This forms a right triangle where the horizontal leg is on the x-axis and the vertical leg is the height.
#### 2. Assigning Values to the Triangle
Since the reference angle is $30^\circ$, we use the side ratios of a standard **30-60-90 triangle** ($1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$). However, we must apply the correct signs based on the quadrant:
* **Opposite ($y$):** $1$ (Positive, because it goes up in QII)
* **Adjacent ($x$):** $-\sqrt{3}$ (Negative, because it goes left in QII)
* **Hypotenuse ($r$):** $2$ (Always positive)

#### 3. Calculating the Values for $150^\circ$
Now, you simply use the ratios from this "drawn" triangle. The trig values for $150^\circ$ are identical to the values for $30^\circ$, just with the signs adjusted for Quadrant II:

* **$\sin(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{1}{2}$** (Positive in QII)
* **$\cos(150^\circ) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$** (Negative in QII)
* **$\tan(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$** (Negative in QII)

#### 4. Why Use the Reference Angle?
The reference angle is a shortcut. Instead of memorizing every single angle on the unit circle, you only need to know the values for $30^\circ, 45^\circ,$ and $60^\circ$. 

**The Rule:**
$$\text{Trig Function}(\theta) = \pm \text{Trig Function}(\theta')$$
You find the value using the acute reference angle ($\theta'$), and then you use the **ASTC rule** to decide if the result should be positive or negative based on the original angle's quadrant.
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = -250^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for a negative angle, we first find its positive coterminal equivalent between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ and then apply the quadrant-specific formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Add $360^\circ$ to the negative angle to find its position in standard position:
* $-250^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{110^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant II**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant II, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$:
* $\theta' = 180^\circ - 110^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 70^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $-250^\circ$   |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $110^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | II             |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$70^\circ$** |
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = 560^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for an angle greater than $360^\circ$, we first find its coterminal equivalent within one full rotation and then apply the appropriate quadrant formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from the original angle to find its position within the first rotation ($0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$):
* $560^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{200^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $180^\circ < 200^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant III, the formula is $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$:
* $\theta' = 200^\circ - 180^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 20^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $560^\circ$    |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $200^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | III            |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$20^\circ$** |
### Evaluating $\cos(-600^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To evaluate the trigonometric value of an angle outside the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range, we follow a three-step process: find a coterminal angle, determine the reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on the quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
First, we add multiples of $360^\circ$ to $-600^\circ$ to find an equivalent angle within the first positive rotation:
* $-600^\circ + 360^\circ = -240^\circ$
* $-240^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{120^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $120^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 120^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 60^\circ$**

#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: According to the ASTC rule, **Cosine is negative** in Quadrant II.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\cos(-600^\circ) = \cos(120^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\cos(60^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step                 | Value                   |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Original Angle**   | $-600^\circ$            |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $120^\circ$             |
| **Quadrant**         | II (Cosine is negative) |
| **Reference Angle**  | $60^\circ$              |
| **Final Value**      | **$-1/2$**              |
### Evaluating $\sec(495^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To find the exact value of $\sec(495^\circ)$, we simplify the angle into the first rotation, find its reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on its quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from $495^\circ$ to find the equivalent angle within the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range:
* $495^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{135^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $135^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 135^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 45^\circ$**



#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: In Quadrant II, only Sine and Cosecant are positive. Therefore, **Secant is negative**.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its reciprocal $\sec(45^\circ) = \sqrt{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\sec(495^\circ) = \sec(135^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sec(45^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sqrt{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step                 | Value                   |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Original Angle**   | $495^\circ$             |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $135^\circ$             |
| **Quadrant**         | II (Secant is negative) |
| **Reference Angle**  | $45^\circ$              |
| **Final Value**      | **$-\sqrt{2}$**         |

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h26m35s
### Finding Trigonometric Function Values Using a Calculator

When exact values (like $\sqrt{3}/2$) are not required or when dealing with non-special angles, calculators are used to find decimal approximations.

#### 1. Setting the Correct Mode
Before performing any calculations, you must ensure your calculator is in the correct mode for the angle unit you are using. Entering a degree value while in radian mode (or vice versa) will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Degree Mode ($^\circ$):** Use this when your angle is given in degrees (e.g., $30^\circ$).
* **Radian Mode:** Use this when your angle is in radians (e.g., $\pi/6$ or $0.5$).

#### 2. Evaluating Primary Functions ($\sin, \cos, \tan$)
Most scientific and graphing calculators have dedicated buttons for these:
* **Steps:** Press the function key (e.g., `SIN`), enter the angle value, and press `ENTER` or =.
* **Example:** To find $\sin(46^\circ)$, ensure you are in degree mode and input `SIN(46)`.

#### 3. Evaluating Reciprocal Functions ($\csc, \sec, \cot$)
Calculators typically do NOT have dedicated buttons for these. You must use their reciprocal identities:
* **Cosecant:** $\csc \theta = 1 / \sin \theta$
* **Secant:** $\sec \theta = 1 / \cos \theta$
* **Cotangent:** $\cot \theta = 1 / \tan \theta$
* **Calculator Input:** To find $\sec(45^\circ)$, you would input `1 / COS(45)`.

#### 4. Inverse Trigonometric Functions
To find an angle $\theta$ when you know the value (e.g., $\sin \theta = 0.5$), use the inverse functions:
* **Buttons:** Usually labeled as $\sin^{-1}$, $\cos^{-1}$, and $\tan^{-1}$ (often accessed via a `2nd` or `SHIFT` key).
* **The Result:** The calculator returns the **principal angle**. For example, `SIN⁻¹(0.5)` returns $30^\circ$.
* **Caution:** The calculator only provides one value. Because functions are periodic, other angles (like $150^\circ$) may share the same value.

#### 5. Summary Table
| Goal | Calculator Input Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Find Sine, Cosine, Tangent** | Use direct buttons (`SIN`, `COS`, `TAN`) |
| **Find Reciprocal Functions** | Use `1 / (Primary Function)` |
| **Find an Angle** | Use Inverse buttons (`SIN⁻¹`, etc.) |
| **Verify Mode** | Check screen for **DEG** or **RAD** |
### Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions to Find Angles

Inverse trigonometric functions are used to "undo" a trigonometric function to find the measure of an unknown angle $\theta$. 

#### 1. Notation: $cos^{-1}$ vs. $arccos$
Both notations refer to the same mathematical operation.
* **$cos^{-1}(x)$**: This is the notation typically used on scientific calculators. It does *not* mean $1/\cos(x)$; it represents the "inverse cosine."
* **$\arccos(x)$**: This is the standard written notation. 
* **The Goal**: If $\cos \theta = x$, then $\theta = \arccos(x)$.

#### 2. The Role of Restrictions
Trigonometric functions are periodic (they repeat forever). This means there are infinite angles that could result in the same cosine value. To get a single, useful answer, we use **Restrictions**.

**Common Restriction: $0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$**
* This tells you the angle must be **acute** (in Quadrant I).
* This is common in geometry and right-triangle problems where negative angles or angles larger than a triangle can hold don't make sense.

#### 3. Using a Calculator with Restrictions
When you use a calculator to find an angle, it follows built-in "Principal Value" ranges.

**For $\cos^{-1}(x)$:**
* The calculator is programmed to only give answers between **$0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$**.
* If your restriction is **$0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$**, you simply use the calculator value directly as long as the input $x$ is positive.

**Step-by-Step Calculator Process:**
1. **Check Mode:** Ensure the calculator is in **DEGREE** mode.
2. **Input:** Press `2nd` or `Shift`, then the `COS` button (this activates $cos^{-1}$).
3. **Value:** Enter the decimal or fraction value.
4. **Solve:** Press `ENTER` or =.

**Example:**
Find $\theta$ if $\cos \theta = 0.866$ and $0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$.
* Input: `cos⁻¹(0.866)`
* Output: $\approx 30^\circ$
* This fits your restriction, so $\theta = 30^\circ$.

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function | Notation | Calculator Buttons | Range of Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inverse Sine** | $\arcsin(x)$ or $\sin^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `SIN` | $-90^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ |
| **Inverse Cosine** | $\arccos(x)$ or $\cos^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `COS` | $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ |
| **Inverse Tangent** | $\arctan(x)$ or $\tan^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `TAN` | $-90^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ |

#### 5. Important Note on Secant/Cosecant/Cotangent
Calculators do not have `sec⁻¹` buttons. To find $\theta$ for $\sec \theta = 2$:
1. Convert to cosine: $\cos \theta = 1/2$.
2. Use the calculator: $\theta = \cos^{-1}(0.5)$.
3. $\theta = 60^\circ$.
## 2026-January-09 - Solving Right Triangles | Angles of Elevation / Depression : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h39m15s
### Solving Right Triangles: Angles of Elevation and Depression

When we "solve" a right triangle, we are finding the lengths of all three sides and the measures of all three angles. Angles of Elevation and Depression are specific types of angles used to solve real-world distance and height problems.

#### 1. Solving a Right Triangle
To solve a right triangle, you generally need to know:
* One side and one acute angle, **OR**
* Two sides.
Once you have these, you use $SOH CAH TOA$ to find the missing pieces.

#### 2. Angle of Elevation
The **Angle of Elevation** is the angle formed by a horizontal line of sight and the line of sight **up** to an object.
* **Point of View**: Looking from the ground up to the top of a building or a bird in a tree.
* **Placement**: It is always inside the triangle at the base, looking up.

#### 3. Angle of Depression
The **Angle of Depression** is the angle formed by a horizontal line of sight and the line of sight **down** to an object.
* **Point of View**: Looking from the top of a cliff down to a boat or from a plane down to a runway.
* **Critical Rule**: The angle of depression is located **outside** the vertical triangle (between the horizontal line and the hypotenuse).

#### 4. The Geometry Shortcut (Parallel Lines)
Because the horizontal line for the "viewer" at the top and the horizontal ground at the bottom are **parallel**, the Angle of Depression is equal to the Angle of Elevation from the object back up to the viewer.
* **Rule**: $\text{Angle of Depression} = \text{Angle of Elevation}$ (due to alternate interior angles).

#### 5. Step-by-Step Problem Solving
1. **Draw a Diagram**: Start with a horizontal line.
2. **Identify the Angle**: Label the angle of elevation or depression.
3. **Label Sides**: Identify which side is the Opposite, Adjacent, or Hypotenuse relative to your angle.
4. **Choose a Function**:
    * Use **Tangent** if you have/need the height and the horizontal distance (Opposite and Adjacent).
    * Use **Sine** or **Cosine** if the hypotenuse (slant distance) is involved.
5. **Solve**: Use your calculator (ensure it's in **DEGREE** mode).

#### 6. Summary Table
| Term                    | Direction of Sight | Angle Location                                 |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Angle of Elevation**  | Upward             | Between horizontal ground and line of sight    |
| **Angle of Depression** | Downward           | Between horizontal eye-level and line of sight |
| **Key Identity**        | Equal              | Both are equal if viewing the same two points  |
### Solving the Right Triangle 

#### 1. Analysis of Given Information
We will use standard notation where $C$ is the right angle and $c$ is the hypotenuse.

* **Angle $C$**: $90^\circ$ (Right angle)
* **Angle $A$**: $37^\circ$ (Given acute angle)
* **Side $c$**: $14$ (Hypotenuse)

#### 2. Solving for the Missing Angle ($B$)
Since the two acute angles in a right triangle must add up to $90^\circ$:
* $B = 90^\circ - 37^\circ$
* **$B = 53^\circ$**

#### 3. Solving for Side $a$ (Opposite to $37^\circ$)
To find the side opposite Angle $A$, we use the **Sine** function ($\sin = \text{Opposite} / \text{Hypotenuse}$):
* $\sin(37^\circ) = \frac{a}{14}$
* $a = 14 \times \sin(37^\circ)$
* $a \approx 14 \times 0.6018$
* **$a \approx 8.43$**

#### 4. Solving for Side $b$ (Adjacent to $37^\circ$)
To find the base side, we use the **Cosine** function ($\cos = \text{Adjacent} / \text{Hypotenuse}$):
* $\cos(37^\circ) = \frac{b}{14}$
* $b = 14 \times \cos(37^\circ)$
* $b \approx 14 \times 0.7986$
* **$b \approx 11.18$**

#### Summary Table
| Part | Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Angle A** | $37^\circ$ | Given |
| **Angle B** | $53^\circ$ | Calculated |
| **Angle C** | $90^\circ$ | Given |
| **Side a (Opposite A)** | $\approx 8.43$ | Calculated |
| **Side b (Adjacent A)** | $\approx 11.18$ | Calculated |
| **Side c (Hypotenuse)** | $14$ | Given |
### Solving the Right Triangle (Hypotenuse and One Leg Given)

To solve this triangle, we use the **Pythagorean Theorem** to find the missing side and **Inverse Trigonometric Functions** to find the missing angles.

#### 1. Analysis of Given Information
In standard right triangle notation (where $C$ is the $90^\circ$ angle):
* **Side $b$ (Adjacent to $A$):** $4$
* **Side $c$ (Hypotenuse):** $15.4$
* **Side $a$ (Opposite to $A$):** Unknown
* **Angle $C$:** $90^\circ$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Solve for Side $a$ (The missing leg)**
We use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
* $a^2 + 4^2 = 15.4^2$
* $a^2 + 16 = 237.16$
* $a^2 = 237.16 - 16$
* $a^2 = 221.16$
* $a = \sqrt{221.16} \approx \mathbf{14.87}$

**Step 2: Solve for Angle $A$**
Since we know the **Adjacent** side ($4$) and the **Hypotenuse** ($15.4$), we use the inverse cosine function ($\arccos$ or $\cos^{-1}$):
* $\cos(A) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{15.4}$
* $A = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{15.4}\right)$
* $A \approx \cos^{-1}(0.2597)$
* **$A \approx 74.95^\circ$**

**Step 3: Solve for Angle $B$**
The two acute angles must sum to $90^\circ$:
* $B = 90^\circ - 74.95^\circ$
* **$B \approx 15.05^\circ$**

### Word Problem: Flagpole Height Calculation

**Problem:**
When Max is **123 feet** away from the base of the school's flagpole, the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is **26° 40'**. Find the height of the flagpole if his eyes are **5.30 feet** above the ground.

---

### 1. Analysis of Given Information
* **Distance (Adjacent side, $b$):** $123$ feet.
* **Angle of Elevation ($\theta$):** $26^\circ 40'$.
* **Eye Level Height ($h_{eye}$):** $5.30$ feet.
* **Goal:** Find the total height of the flagpole ($H$).


---

### 2. Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Convert Angle to Decimal Degrees
Trigonometric functions in code and most calculators work best with decimal degrees. Since there are 60 minutes in a degree:
* $40' = \frac{40}{60} = 0.666...^\circ$
* $\theta = 26.667^\circ$

#### Step 2: Solve for the height above eye level ($a$)
We use the **Tangent** function because we have the **Adjacent** side ($123$) and want to find the **Opposite** side ($a$).
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$$
* $\tan(26.667^\circ) = \frac{a}{123}$
* $a = 123 \times \tan(26.667^\circ)$
* $a \approx 123 \times 0.5022$
* $a \approx \mathbf{61.77 \text{ feet}}$

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Height ($H$)
To get the total height of the flagpole, we must add Max's eye level height to the calculated side $a$.
* $H = a + h_{eye}$
* $H = 61.77 + 5.30$
* **$H \approx 67.07 \text{ feet}$**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h51m35s
### Converting Between Radians and Degrees

Trigonometry uses two primary units to measure rotation: **Degrees** (based on a $360^\circ$ circle) and **Radians** (based on the radius of the circle).

#### 1. The Core Relationship
The conversion is based on the fact that a half-circle ($180^\circ$) is equal to $\pi$ radians.
* **Full Circle:** $360^\circ = 2\pi$ radians
* **Half Circle:** $180^\circ = \pi$ radians

---

#### 2. Conversion Formulas

To convert from one unit to the other, multiply by the appropriate conversion factor:

**Degrees to Radians**
Multiply the degrees by $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$:
$$\text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$

**Radians to Degrees**
Multiply the radians by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$:
$$\text{Degrees} = \text{Radians} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$$

---

#### 3. Common Reference Values
| Degrees         | Radians (Exact) | Radians (Approx) |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| **$30^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $0.524$          |
| **$45^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{4}$ | $0.785$          |
| **$60^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $1.047$          |
| **$90^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | $1.571$          |
| **$180^\circ$** | $\pi$           | $3.142$          |
| **$360^\circ$** | $2\pi$          | $6.283$          |


---

#### 4. Memory Trick
* If you want to get **Radians**, you want $\pi$ in the "numerator" (top).
* If you want to get **Degrees**, you want $\pi$ in the "denominator" (bottom) so it cancels out.
### Conversion: 150 Degrees to Radians

To convert degrees to radians, we multiply by the conversion factor $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$. This works because $\pi$ radians and $180^\circ$ represent the same amount of rotation (a half-circle).

#### 1. The Calculation
$$\text{Radians} = 150^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$



#### 2. Simplifying the Fraction
1.  **Set up the fraction:** $\frac{150\pi}{180}$
2.  **Divide by the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Both 150 and 180 are divisible by 30.
    * $150 \div 30 = 5$
    * $180 \div 30 = 6$



#### 3. Final Results
* **Exact Form:** $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ radians
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 2.618$ radians
### Conversion: 260 Degrees to Radians

To convert degrees to radians, we use the conversion factor $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$. This formula cancels out the degree units and introduces radians.

#### 1. The Setup
$$\text{Radians} = 260^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$

#### 2. Simplifying the Fraction
1.  **Write as a single fraction:** $\frac{260\pi}{180}$
2.  **Simplify by dividing by the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
    * Both 260 and 180 are divisible by 20.
    * $260 \div 20 = 13$
    * $180 \div 20 = 9$

#### 3. Final Result
* **Exact Form:** $\frac{13\pi}{9}$ radians
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 4.538$ radians
### Conversion: -157π/36 Radians to Degrees

To convert from radians to degrees, we multiply the value by the conversion factor $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. This allows the $\pi$ terms to cancel out, leaving the final measurement in degrees.

#### 1. The Mathematical Setup
$$\text{Degrees} = \left( -\frac{157\pi}{36} \right) \times \left( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \right)$$

---

#### 2. Step-by-Step Simplification

**Step A: Cancel the $\pi$ terms**
Since $\pi$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, they cancel out:
$$-\frac{157}{36} \times 180^\circ$$

**Step B: Simplify the numbers**
Instead of multiplying $157 \times 180$ first, it is more efficient to divide $180$ by $36$:
1.  Check if 36 goes into 180: $180 \div 36 = 5$.
2.  Rewrite the expression: $-157 \times 5^\circ$.



**Step C: Final Multiplication**
$$-157 \times 5 = -785$$

---

#### 3. Final Result
* **Degrees:** $-785^\circ$
### Conversion: -43π/12 Radians to Degrees

To convert radians to degrees, we multiply by the conversion factor $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. This setup ensures that the $\pi$ units cancel out, leaving the value in degrees.

#### 1. The Mathematical Setup
$$\text{Degrees} = \left( -\frac{43\pi}{12} \right) \times \left( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \right)$$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Simplification

**Step A: Cancel the $\pi$ terms**
The $\pi$ in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out:
$$-\frac{43}{12} \times 180^\circ$$

**Step B: Simplify the division**
It is much easier to divide $180$ by $12$ before multiplying by $43$:
1.  $180 \div 12 = 15$
2.  Now the expression is: $-43 \times 15^\circ$



**Step C: Final Multiplication**
$$-43 \times 15 = -645$$

#### 3. Final Result
* **Degrees:** $-645^\circ$

## 2026-January-10 - Arc Length on a Circle - Area of a Sector of a Circle :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h3m30s
### Arc Length on a Circle

The **Arc Length** ($s$) is the distance along the curved line that makes up a section of a circle's circumference. Think of it as the "crust" of a pizza slice.

#### 1. The Core Formulas
The formula you use depends on whether your central angle ($\theta$) is in **Radians** or **Degrees**.

**If $\theta$ is in Radians (The Direct Method):**
Since a radian is defined by the ratio of the arc length to the radius, the formula is elegant and simple:
$$s = r\theta$$
*(Where $s$ = arc length, $r$ = radius, and $\theta$ = central angle in radians)*

**If $\theta$ is in Degrees (The Proportional Method):**
You take a fraction of the total circumference ($2\pi r$):
$$s = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r$$



---

#### 2. Visual Relationship
* If $\theta = 2\pi$ (a full circle), then $s = 2\pi r$ (the full circumference).
* If $\theta = \pi$ (a half circle), then $s = \pi r$.
* If $\theta = 1$ radian, then $s = r$ (the arc length is exactly equal to the radius).

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation (Example)
**Problem:** Find the arc length if the radius is **6 cm** and the central angle is **$120^\circ$**.

1.  **Convert to Radians (Recommended):**
    $$120^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{ radians}$$
2.  **Apply the formula ($s = r\theta$):**
    $$s = 6 \times \frac{2\pi}{3}$$
3.  **Simplify:**
    $$s = 4\pi \approx 12.57 \text{ cm}$$
### Area of a Sector of a Circle

A **sector** of a circle is the portion of the disk enclosed by two radii and an arc. You can think of it as a "slice" of a pizza or pie.

---
#### Geometric Definition
The area of a sector depends on the **radius ($r$)** of the circle and the **central angle ($\theta$)** subtended by the arc at the center.

---
#### Formula 1: Using Radians
When the angle $\theta$ is measured in **radians**, the formula is derived from the proportion of the sector's area to the total area of the circle ($A = \pi r^2$):

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta$$

* **$r$**: Radius of the circle
* **$\theta$**: Central angle in radians

---
#### Formula 2: Using Degrees
If the angle $\theta$ is measured in **degrees**, the formula is adjusted to represent the fraction of the $360^\circ$ circle:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$$

---
#### Relationship to Arc Length
Since the arc length $s$ is defined as $s = r\theta$, you can also express the area in terms of the arc length:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} rs$$

---
#### Example Calculation
**Problem:** Find the area of a sector with a radius of $6\text{ cm}$ and a central angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians.

1.  **Identify variables:** $r = 6$, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.
2.  **Apply formula:** $A = \frac{1}{2}(6)^2(\frac{\pi}{3})$.
3.  **Simplify:** $A = \frac{1}{2}(36)(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 18(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 6\pi\text{ cm}^2$.
## 2026-January-10 - Unit Circle and Circular Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h16m45s
### Unit Circle and Circular Functions

The **Unit Circle** is a circle with a radius of 1 ($r = 1$) centered at the origin $(0, 0)$ in the Cartesian plane. It is the fundamental tool for defining trigonometric functions for all real numbers, moving beyond simple right-triangle geometry.

---
#### 1. The Unit Circle Equation
The algebraic representation of the unit circle is:
$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$

Any point $P(x, y)$ on the circumference of this circle corresponds to a central angle $\theta$ (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis).

---
#### 2. Defining Circular Functions
In a unit circle, because the hypotenuse is always 1, the trigonometric ratios simplify directly to the coordinates of the point $P(x, y)$:

* **Cosine**: $\cos(\theta) = x$
* **Sine**: $\sin(\theta) = y$
* **Tangent**: $\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ (where $x \neq 0$)

These are called **circular functions** because their values are determined by the position of a point moving around a circle.

---

#### 3. Reciprocal and Related Functions
From these primary definitions, we derive the remaining circular functions:
* **Secant**: $\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}$
* **Cosecant**: $\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{y}$
* **Cotangent**: $\cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y}$

---

#### 4. The Pythagorean Identity
Since every point $(x, y)$ on the circle satisfies $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, substituting our circular functions gives the fundamental identity:
$$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$$

---

#### 5. Signs by Quadrant (ASTC)
The signs of the circular functions depend on the quadrant where the terminal side of the angle $\theta$ lies:
| Quadrant | Coordinates | Positive Functions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** ($0$ to $\pi/2$) | $(+, +)$ | **A**ll (Sin, Cos, Tan) |
| **II** ($\pi/2$ to $\pi$) | $(-, +)$ | **S**ine (and Csc) |
| **III** ($\pi$ to $3\pi/2$) | $(-, -)$ | **T**angent (and Cot) |
| **IV** ($3\pi/2$ to $2\pi$) | $(+, -)$ | **C**osine (and Sec) |

### Arc Length on the Unit Circle

On a **Unit Circle**, the radius is exactly $1$ ($r = 1$). This unique property creates a direct numerical link between the central angle and the distance traveled along the edge of the circle.

---

#### 1. The Arc Length Formula
The general formula for arc length $s$ is:
$$s = r\theta$$

Where:
* $s$ is the arc length.
* $r$ is the radius.
* $\theta$ is the central angle in **radians**.

---

#### 2. The $s = \theta$ Relationship
Because $r = 1$ on the unit circle, the formula simplifies to:
$$s = (1)\theta \implies s = \theta$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On a unit circle, the **arc length is numerically equal to the central angle** (when measured in radians). For example, if the central angle is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the distance along the curve is also exactly $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units.



---

#### 3. Comparison: Degrees vs. Radians
| Measurement | Formula for Unit Circle ($r=1$) | Example ($90^\circ$ or $\pi/2$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Radians** | $s = \theta$ | $s = \pi/2 \approx 1.57$ |
| **Degrees** | $s = \frac{\pi \theta}{180}$ | $s = \frac{90\pi}{180} = \pi/2$ |

---

#### 4. Why This Matters
This relationship is the reason why **radians** are the preferred unit in calculus and physics. It treats the angle as a physical distance along the circle's path, making circular motion and wave functions much easier to calculate.
### Special Angles and Reference Triangles on the Unit Circle

The coordinates $(x, y)$ for special angles on the unit circle are derived from two specific right triangles where the hypotenuse is $1$.

---

#### 1. The $45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ$ Triangle ($\pi/4$)
When the central angle is $45^\circ$ (or $\pi/4$ radians), the triangle is isosceles.
* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$
* **Trig Values:** $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$


---

#### 2. The $30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ$ Triangle ($\pi/6$ and $\pi/3$)
This triangle provides the coordinates for both $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ by swapping the long and short legs.

* **At $30^\circ$ ($\pi/6$):** The horizontal leg ($x$) is longer.
	* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$
* **At $60^\circ$ ($\pi/3$):** The vertical leg ($y$) is longer.
	* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$


---

#### 3. Summary Table (Quadrant I)
| Angle (Deg) | Angle (Rad) | $x$ ($\cos \theta$) | $y$ ($\sin \theta$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0^\circ$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $30^\circ$ | $\pi/6$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $45^\circ$ | $\pi/4$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $\pi/3$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | $\pi/2$ | $0$ | $1$ |

---

#### 4. Quadrantal Angles
These are angles where the terminal side lies on an axis. They do not form triangles but represent the "boundaries" of the circle:
* **Positive x-axis ($0$):** $(1, 0)$
* **Positive y-axis ($\pi/2$):** $(0, 1)$
* **Negative x-axis ($\pi$):** $(-1, 0)$
* **Negative y-axis ($3\pi/2$):** $(0, -1)$

### Summary of Unit Circle Memory Tricks

The coordinates for special angles in the first quadrant follow a predictable mathematical pattern. By using these counting methods, you can derive the entire unit circle without rote memorization.

---

#### 1. The Square Root Counting Trick
Every coordinate in the first quadrant has a denominator of **2**. You simply count from 0 to 4 inside a square root for the numerators.

| Angle ($\theta$) | $x$-coordinate ($\frac{\sqrt{\text{count}}}{2}$) | $y$-coordinate ($\frac{\sqrt{\text{count}}}{2}$) | Resulting $(x, y)$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$0^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} = 1$ | $\frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} = 0$ | $(1, 0)$ |
| **$30^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ | $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ |
| **$45^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ |
| **$60^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ |
| **$90^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} = 0$ | $\frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} = 1$ | $(0, 1)$ |

* **To find Cosine ($x$):** Count **down** from 4 to 0.
* **To find Sine ($y$):** Count **up** from 0 to 4.

---

#### 2. The Left-Hand Rule
A physical way to remember the coordinates:
1.  **Assign Fingers:** Thumb ($90^\circ$), Index ($60^\circ$), Middle ($45^\circ$), Ring ($30^\circ$), Pinky ($0^\circ$).
2.  **Fold a Finger:** To find values for an angle, fold that specific finger.
3.  **Calculate:**
    * **$\cos \theta$:** $\frac{\sqrt{\text{fingers above}}}{2}$
    * **$\sin \theta$:** $\frac{\sqrt{\text{fingers below}}}{2}$

---

#### 3. Tangent Values Trick
Since $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$, you can use the "Fingers Below over Fingers Above" trick:
$$\tan \theta = \sqrt{\frac{\text{fingers below}}{\text{fingers above}}}$$

* **$\tan(30^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{1/3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$
* **$\tan(45^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{2/2} = 1$
* **$\tan(60^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{3/1} = \sqrt{3}$

---

#### 4. ASTC: Quadrant Signs
To remember which functions are **positive** in each quadrant, use the mnemonic:
**A**ll **S**tudents **T**ake **C**alculus

* **Q1 (A):** **A**ll functions are positive.
* **Q2 (S):** **S**ine (and Csc) are positive.
* **Q3 (T):** **T**angent (and Cot) are positive.
* **Q4 (C):** **C**osine (and Sec) are positive.

### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = \frac{3\pi}{4}$

To solve for the trigonometric values of $\frac{3\pi}{4}$, we locate the angle on the unit circle and use its reference angle and quadrant.

---

#### 1. Locate the Angle
* **Position:** $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant II** (between $\pi/2$ and $\pi$).
* **Reference Angle ($\theta'$):** The distance to the x-axis is $\pi - \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ (or $45^\circ$).



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
In Quadrant II, the $x$-coordinate is negative and the $y$-coordinate is positive. Using the values for a $45^\circ$ reference angle:
* **$x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\cos \theta = x$, and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:

* **$\sin \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\sin \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
* **$\cos \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\cos \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
* **$\tan \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\tan \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1$$

---

#### 4. Verification (ASTC)
In Quadrant II, only **Sine** (and Cosecant) should be positive.
* Sine is positive ($\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$) ✅
* Cosine is negative ($-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$) ✅
* Tangent is negative ($-1$) ✅
### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = \frac{13\pi}{6}$

To solve for the trigonometric values of $\frac{13\pi}{6}$, we first need to find its **coterminal angle** within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range.

---

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Since $\frac{13\pi}{6}$ is greater than $2\pi$ ($\frac{12\pi}{6}$), we subtract one full rotation:
$$\frac{13\pi}{6} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{6} - \frac{12\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

* **Position:** $\frac{\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\circ$) is in **Quadrant I**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\frac{\pi}{6}$.



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
Using the special angle values for $\frac{\pi}{6}$ in Quadrant I, both $x$ and $y$ are positive:
* **$x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{1}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{x}$, and $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{y}$:

### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = -\frac{23\pi}{4}$

To solve for an angle like $-\frac{23\pi}{4}$, we first find a **coterminal angle** within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range to identify its position on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
We add multiples of $2\pi$ (which is $\frac{8\pi}{4}$) until we get a positive value between $0$ and $2\pi$:

$$-\frac{23\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = -\frac{15\pi}{4}$$
$$-\frac{15\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = -\frac{7\pi}{4}$$
$$-\frac{7\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

* **Position:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$ (or $45^\circ$) is in **Quadrant I**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$.



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
Using the special angle values for $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in Quadrant I:
* **$x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\cos \theta = x$, and $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$:

* **$\sin \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\sin \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cos \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\cos \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cot \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\cot \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1$$

---

#### 4. Verification (ASTC)
Since the coterminal angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant I**, **A**ll functions should be positive.
* Sine is positive ✅
* Cosine is positive ✅
* Cotangent is positive ✅

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h33m25s
### Linear and Angular Speed

When an object moves along a circular path, we can describe its motion in two ways: how fast it travels along the edge (**linear speed**) and how fast the central angle changes (**angular speed**).

---

#### 1. Angular Speed ($\omega$)
Angular speed measures the rate at which the central angle $\theta$ changes over time. It is represented by the Greek letter omega ($\omega$).

**Formula:**
$$\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$$

* **$\omega$**: Angular speed (usually in radians per unit of time).
* **$\theta$**: Central angle in **radians**.
* **$t$**: Time.

> [!CAUTION]
> If the problem gives you rotations or degrees, you **must** convert to radians first. ($1$ rotation $= 2\pi$ radians).

---

#### 2. Linear Speed ($v$)
Linear speed measures the distance traveled along the arc ($s$) per unit of time. It is the "speedometer" speed of an object moving in a circle.

**Formula:**
$$v = \frac{s}{t}$$

Since arc length $s = r\theta$, we can also write:
$$v = \frac{r\theta}{t}$$



---

#### 3. Relationship Between Linear and Angular Speed
The most useful way to connect these two concepts is through the radius ($r$). Since $v = \frac{r\theta}{t}$ and $\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$, we can substitute:

$$v = r\omega$$

* **Linear speed ($v$)** is the product of the **radius ($r$)** and the **angular speed ($\omega$)**.

---

#### 4. Example Calculation
**Problem:** A wheel with a radius of $10$ inches is spinning at $3$ revolutions per second. Find its linear speed.

1.  **Find Angular Speed ($\omega$):**
    $3 \text{ rev/sec} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 6\pi \text{ rad/sec}$.
2.  **Calculate Linear Speed ($v$):**
    $v = r\omega$
    $v = 10 \text{ in} \times 6\pi \text{ rad/sec} = 60\pi \text{ in/sec}$.
3.  **Decimal Approximation:**
    $\approx 188.5 \text{ in/sec}$.

---

#### 5. Comparison Table
| Feature      | Angular Speed ($\omega$) | Linear Speed ($v$) |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Measures** | Change in angle          | Change in distance |
| **Units**    | rad/sec, rpm             | m/s, mph, in/sec   |
| **Formula**  | $\omega = \theta / t$    | $v = s / t$        |
| **Relation** | $\omega = v / r$         | $v = r\omega$      |
### Word Problem: Linear Speed of a Cart on a Circular Track

**Problem:**
At a local high school, Max rides his cart around a circular track at $2$ revolutions per minute. If the radius of the circular track is $150$ meters, how fast is Max's cart traveling in meters per second?

---

#### 1. Given Information
* **Radius ($r$):** $150 \text{ m}$
* **Angular Speed ($\omega$):** $2 \text{ rev/min}$
* **Target Units:** Meters per second ($\text{m/s}$)

---

#### 2. Conversion Constants
* $1 \text{ revolution} = 2\pi \text{ radians}$
* $1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}$

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Convert Angular Speed to radians per second**
First, convert revolutions per minute to radians per minute:
$$\omega = 2 \text{ rev/min} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 4\pi \text{ rad/min}$$

Now, convert radians per minute to radians per second:
$$\omega = \frac{4\pi \text{ rad}}{60 \text{ sec}} = \frac{\pi}{15} \text{ rad/sec}$$

**Step 2: Calculate Linear Speed ($v$)**
Using the relationship formula $v = r\omega$:
$$v = 150 \text{ m} \times \frac{\pi}{15} \text{ rad/sec}$$



**Step 3: Simplify**
$$v = \frac{150\pi}{15} = 10\pi \text{ m/s}$$

---

#### 4. Final Result
* **Exact Value:** $10\pi \text{ m/s}$
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 31.42 \text{ m/s}$

> [!SUCCESS] Answer
> Max's cart is traveling at exactly **$10\pi$ meters per second**, which is approximately **$31.42 \text{ m/s}$**.

## 2026-January-11 - Graphing Sine and Cosine :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h47m20s
### Periodic Functions: $f(x) = f(x + np)$

A **periodic function** is a function that repeats its values at regular intervals or "periods." This is a core property of trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

---

#### 1. Mathematical Definition
A function $f$ is periodic if there exists a non-zero constant $p$ such that:
$$f(x) = f(x + p)$$
for all values of $x$ in the domain. The smallest positive value of $p$ is called the **fundamental period** (or simply the **period**).

---

#### 2. The Multi-Period Property: $f(x) = f(x + np)$
If a function repeats every $p$ units, it also repeats every $2p$, $3p$, or any integer multiple of $p$.
$$f(x) = f(x + np)$$
* **$n$**: Any integer ($\dots, -2, -1, 1, 2, \dots$).
* **$p$**: The period of the function.

> [!NOTE]
> This means that if you know the behavior of the function over one period (the interval $[0, p]$), you know its behavior for all real numbers.



---

#### 3. Examples in Trigonometry
The standard trigonometric functions are the most common examples of periodic behavior:

| Function | Period ($p$) | Property |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin(x)$** | $2\pi$ | $\sin(x) = \sin(x + 2n\pi)$ |
| **$\cos(x)$** | $2\pi$ | $\cos(x) = \cos(x + 2n\pi)$ |
| **$\tan(x)$** | $\pi$ | $\tan(x) = \tan(x + n\pi)$ |

---

#### 4. Visualizing the Concept
Think of a periodic function like a **stamp**. One period is the design on the stamp; the function itself is what happens when you press that stamp repeatedly across a piece of paper.

* **Cycles:** One complete execution of the pattern is called a cycle.
* **Frequency:** The number of cycles that occur per unit of horizontal distance ($1/p$).

---

#### 5. Application: Solving for Large Angles
Because of the $f(x) = f(x + np)$ property, you can simplify large angles by subtracting multiples of the period:
**Example:** Find $\sin( \frac{13\pi}{4} )$.
1.  Subtract $2\pi$ (one period): $\frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$.
2.  $\sin( \frac{13\pi}{4} ) = \sin( \frac{5\pi}{4} ) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
### Graphing Sine and Cosine Functions

This section of the course focuses on the visual representation of the periodic functions $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$. It introduces the standard form used for transformations:

$$y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k$$

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs
* **Sine ($y = \sin x$):** Starts at the origin $(0,0)$, goes up to its maximum, down through the x-axis, to its minimum, and back to the start.
* **Cosine ($y = \cos x$):** Starts at its maximum $(0, a)$, goes down through the x-axis to its minimum, and back up to the maximum.

![[Pasted image 20260111145830.png]]
- **x intercepts** are on the $n*\pi$ : $\pi$  and $2\pi$
- **Maximum** Occurs at 1/4 of the way through : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 
- **Minimum** Occurs at 3/4 of the way through : $\frac{3\pi}{2}$
![[Pasted image 20260111165817.png]]
- $f(x) = cos x$ : Cos graphs are just phaseshifted $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units left, exactly the same as sin graphs, just different start
- **X Intercepts** : $(2n + 1)\frac{\pi}{2}$ : x intercepts are found at 2n + 1 times pi over 2
- 
---

#### 2. Key Vocabulary & Transformations
* **Amplitude ($|a|$):** Half the distance between the maximum and minimum values. It describes the "height" of the wave.
    * If $a < 0$, the graph is **reflected** over the x-axis.
* **Period ($P$):** The horizontal length of one complete cycle. 
    * Formula: $P = \frac{2\pi}{b}$
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** The horizontal shift (left or right).
    * $x - h$ shifts **right**.
    * $x + h$ shifts **left**.
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** The vertical shift (up or down). This also determines the **midline** of the graph.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Graphing Process
1.  **Identify the Midline ($k$):** Draw a dashed horizontal line at $y = k$.
2.  **Determine Amplitude:** Mark the max and min boundaries ($k + a$ and $k - a$).
3.  **Calculate the Period:** Find the end of one cycle using $2\pi/b$.
4.  **Divide into "Key Points":** Divide the period into four equal intervals. This gives you the five critical points:
    * *Start, Quarter-way, Midpoint, Three-quarters, End.*
5.  **Apply Phase Shift:** Slide those five points left or right based on $h$.
6.  **Sketch the Curve:** Connect the points with a smooth, continuous wave.

---

$$y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k$$

- **f(x) = -2 sin x**  : 2 things going on in this image, 1) *2* a vertical stretch that doubles it's size, and 2) a '*-*' negative which flips it on the x axis 
![[Pasted image 20260111161856.png]]
- **$f(x) = 3sin \frac{1}{3}x$** : 2 things going on in this one : 1) '*3*' vertical stretch 2) $\frac{x}{3}$ or $\frac{1}{3}x$ horizontal stretch of 3 (notice how one cycle ends at $6\pi$ instead of $2\pi$ - a 1/3 stretch is inverted and actually increase it by 3)
![[Pasted image 20260111163321.png]]
- $f(x) = 4 sin (2x -2\pi / 3)$ : (factor out the '2') $f(x) = 4 sin [2(x -\pi / 3)]$ : Phase/Horizontal Shift : $(x -\pi / 3)$ this *counterintuitively* shifts it to the right by 3, and it starts at $\frac{\pi}{3}$  instead of '0', 
- the other transformations are '4' vertical stretch by factor of 4, and '2x' = horizontal compressed by factor of 1/2 (runs through a cycle in half the time)
![[Pasted image 20260111164523.png]]
- $f(x) = 4 sin (3x + 3\pi / 4) -1$ : (factor out the '3') $f(x) = 4 sin [3(x + \frac{\pi}{4})]-1$ Vertical Shift '-1' at the end, drops it down one on the y axis
- Other transformations are : '4' sin increases the vertical stretch by a factor of 4, horizontal compression of 1/3, phase shift left by $\pi / 4$

## 2026-January-12 Graphing a Tangent and Cotangent :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=4h54m45s
- $tan x = tan(x + \pi n)$ 
- $cot x = cot(x + \pi n)$ 
- When working with *sine and cosine* the period is $2\pi$, when working with *tan and cot* the period is $\pi$ 
- **Period** : How often it repeats
- $tan x = \frac{sin x}{cos x}$ :You can find the *tangent* on a *unit circle* by dividing the *sine* by the *cosine*
- $tan \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{sin\frac{\pi}{6}}{cos\frac{\pi}{6}}$ : $\frac{1}{2}$ * $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$  to find the tangent of pi over 6(30$\degree$), divide the $sin\frac{\pi}{6}$ by $cos\frac{\pi}{6}$ on a unit circle
- $\frac{\pi}{2}$ + $\pi n$ : Whenever the $cos$ value is '0' the value of tangent is **undefined**, this includes $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ as well as their coterminal angles - The tangent is undefined at *odd multiples* of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 
- When *sin* is 0 and *cos* is not 0, tan will be '0'
- The closer you get to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the closer you get to $\infty$, **increase without bound** but will never touch $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which is *undefined*
- **Consecutive Vertical Asymptotes** : When you have repeating vertical asymptotes (approaches infinitely, but doesn't touch)
- **Quarter Period** : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ * $\frac{1}{4}$ 
-  $cot x = \frac{cos x}{sin x}$ :You can find the *cotangent* on a *unit circle* by dividing the *cosine* by the *sine* - Since sine and cosine are switched, anywhere that sine is '0' cot will be 'undefined' and anywhere that cos is '0' cot will be '0'
- cot $\pi n$ will be where the undefined sections are
### Graphing Tangent and Cotangent Functions

Tangent and cotangent functions are unique because they are defined as ratios that include variables in the denominator ($\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$ and $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$). This results in **vertical asymptotes** where the denominator is zero.

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs
* **Tangent ($y = \tan x$):**
    * **Period:** $\pi$ (repeats twice as often as sine/cosine).
    * **Asymptotes:** Occur at $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$ (where $\cos x = 0$).
    * **Shape:** An increasing "S-curve" that passes through the origin $(0,0)$.
![[Pasted image 20260112162129.png]]
- **Memorize these three points** When graphing a tangent, the main points you want to find are $(\frac{-\pi}{4}, -1)$, $(0,0)$, $(\frac{\pi}{4}, 1)$ to get the main shape of the tangent - To find the next point of a similiar type, add $\frac{\pi}{8}$ 
- *X Intercepts* are of the form $x=\pi n$ where 'n' is any integer - The x intercept occurs at *1/2* of the way between the consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '0'
- *1\4* of the way between consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '-1'
- *3\4* of the way between consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '-1'
- There are no minimum or maximum values
- The range is *infinite*
- The graph has *no amplitude*
- The graph is symetric with respect to the origin

* **Cotangent ($y = \cot x$):**
    * **Period:** $\pi$.
    * **Asymptotes:** Occur at $x = n\pi$ (where $\sin x = 0$).
    * **Shape:** A decreasing curve that is a horizontal shift and reflection of the tangent graph.
![[Pasted image 20260112175704.png]]
- **Memorize these three points** When graphing a tangent, the main points you want to find are the quarter point, mid point and three quarter point : $(\frac{\pi}{4}, 1)$ , $(\frac{\pi}{2},0)$,  $(\frac{3 \pi}{4}, -1)$ to get the main shape of the tangent - To find the next point of a similiar type, add $\frac{\pi}{8}$ 
- **X intercept** : $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n$ : the x intercepts occuer at 1/2 of the way between the consecutive vertical asymptotes
![[Pasted image 20260112180240.png]]
---

#### 2. Key Features and Transformations
Standard form: $y = a \tan(b(x - h)) + k$

* **Period ($P$):** For tangent and cotangent, the period is calculated as:
    $$P = \frac{\pi}{b}$$
* **Vertical Asymptotes:** These bound one full cycle of the graph.
    * For $y = \tan(bx)$, solve: $-\frac{\pi}{2} < bx < \frac{\pi}{2}$
    * For $y = \cot(bx)$, solve: $0 < bx < \pi$
* **Amplitude (Vertical Stretch):** While these functions don't have a maximum or minimum, the value of $|a|$ affects the "steepness" of the curve. The "quarter-points" of the cycle will be at $y = k + a$ and $y = k - a$.

![[Pasted image 20260112165156.png]]
- $f(x) = 2 tan(2x + 2\pi / 3) + 1$ : (pull out the 2) $f(x) = 2 tan[2(x + \pi / 3)] + 1$ : '2' tan stretches the distance between the middle/quarter/three quarter point by 2, the '+1' adds a vertical shift of one up, '2' that was pulled out is counterintuitive *horizontal compression/shrink* of a factor of 2(divide by 2 or multiply by 1/2), the $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is the phase shift and is counterintuitive because you will go $\frac{\pi}{3}$ to the *LEFT*

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Graphing Process
1.  **Find the Period:** $P = \pi/b$.
2.  **Locate Asymptotes:** Find where the function is undefined for one cycle.
3.  **Find the Midpoint:** The point exactly between the asymptotes is the x-intercept (or the point on the midline $k$).
4.  **Find Quarter-Points:** Halfway between the midpoint and each asymptote, the y-value will be $k \pm a$.
5.  **Sketch the Curve:** Draw the smooth curve approaching the asymptotes.

* **Vertical Stretch ($a$):** $1$
* **Period ($P$):** $\frac{\pi}{|b|} = \frac{\pi}{1/2} = 2\pi$
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ (Shifted left by $\frac{2\pi}{3}$)
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** $0$ (The midline is the x-axis, $y = 0$)

---

#### 2. Vertical Asymptotes (VA)
Find the boundaries for one principal cycle by setting the argument of the cotangent function equal to the standard parent asymptotes for cotangent ($0$ and $\pi$):

* **Left VA:** $$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi}{3} = 0 \implies \frac{x}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{3} \implies x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$$
* **Right VA:** $$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi}{3} = \pi \implies \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \implies x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$$

---

#### 3. Key Points Calculation
The period is $2\pi$. Divide this interval into four equal sections of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (or $\frac{3\pi}{6}$) each to find the critical graphing points.

| Point | x-coordinate | y-coordinate ($k$, $k \pm a$) | Final $(x, y)$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Left VA** | $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ | Undefined | VA at $x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$ |
| **Quarter Point** | $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $k + a = 0 + 1 = 1$ | $(-\frac{\pi}{6}, 1)$ |
| **Midpoint** | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $k = 0$ | $(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0)$ |
| **3/4 Point** | $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ | $k - a = 0 - 1 = -1$ | $(\frac{5\pi}{6}, -1)$ |
| **Right VA** | $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ | Undefined | VA at $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$ |

---

#### 4. Summary for Graphing
* **Midpoint (x-intercept):** $(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0)$
* **Horizontal Step Size:** $\frac{\pi}{2}$
* **Vertical Asymptotes:** $x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$
* **Behavior:** The graph is decreasing between asymptotes (typical for cotangent with $a > 0$).

### Detailed Guide: Graphing Secant and Cosecant Functions

To graph these functions in detail, you must view them as the "extrapolation" of Sine and Cosine. They do not exist independently of their reciprocal guides.

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs
The parent functions $y = \csc(x)$ and $y = \sec(x)$ have a period of $2\pi$.

**$y = \csc(x)$ (Reciprocal of Sine):**
* **Asymptotes:** $x = 0, \pi, 2\pi$ (where $\sin(x) = 0$).
* **Relative Minimum:** $( \frac{\pi}{2}, 1 )$.
* **Relative Maximum:** $( \frac{3\pi}{2}, -1 )$.

![[Pasted image 20260113180849.png]]

**$y = \sec(x)$ (Reciprocal of Cosine):**
* **Asymptotes:** $x = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}$ (where $\cos(x) = 0$).
* **Relative Minimum:** $( 0, 1 )$ and $( 2\pi, 1 )$.
* **Relative Maximum:** $( \pi, -1 )$.
![[Pasted image 20260113163358.png]]
The Secant Curve and its Characteristics : 
* The domain consists of all real numbers except odd multiples of $\pi/2$
- f(x) = sec x is discontinuous at odd multiples of $\pi/2$
- The graph contains vertical asymptotes at those values
- There are no x-intercepts
- The period is $2\pi$
- There no minimum or maximum values
- The range is: (-$\infty$ ,-1] U [1,$\infty$)
- The graph has no amplitude
- The graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis
- sec(-x) = sec x, for all x in the domain
- f(x) = sec x is an even function

#### 2. Standard Form & Transformations
$$y = a \csc(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \sec(b(x - h)) + k$$

| Transformation | Variable | Impact on Secant / Cosecant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vertical Stretch** | $|a|$ | Moves the vertices further from the midline. The "gap" becomes $2|a|$ units high. |
| **Period** | $P = \frac{2\pi}{b}$ | The horizontal distance between the start of one "Up-U" and the end of the next "Down-U." |
| **Phase Shift** | $h$ | Slides the starting point of the reciprocal wave left or right. |
| **Vertical Shift** | $k$ | Moves the entire graph up or down. The vertices will be at $y = k + a$ and $y = k - a$. |

---

#### 3. Deep-Dive Graphing Procedure (The "Ghost" Method)

To graph $y = a \csc(b(x - h)) + k$ with high precision:

##### Step A: Graph the "Ghost" Wave
Sketch $y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k$ lightly. 
1.  Identify the **Midline** ($y = k$).
2.  Use $a$ to find the **Amplitude** above and below the midline.
3.  Use $P = 2\pi/b$ and $h$ to find the five critical points of the Sine wave.
##### Step B: Identify Asymptotes
Draw a vertical dashed line through every point where your "Ghost" wave **crosses the midline**. 
* *Note:* If there is no vertical shift ($k=0$), these are simply the x-intercepts.

##### Step C: Plot the Vertices and Curves
1.  **Vertex Up:** At the **peaks** of the ghost wave, draw a parabola-like curve opening upward toward the asymptotes.
2.  **Vertex Down:** At the **valleys** of the ghost wave, draw a parabola-like curve opening downward toward the asymptotes.

### Finding Secant via Cosine Reciprocals on the Unit Circle

The secant function ($y = \sec \theta$) is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine function ($y = \cos \theta$). On the unit circle, this relationship allows us to derive secant values directly from coordinate points.

---

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definition
Every point on the unit circle is represented by the coordinates $(x, y)$, where:
* $x = \cos \theta$
* $y = \sin \theta$

Because $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$, it follows that on the unit circle:
$$\sec \theta = \frac{1}{x}$$

---

#### 2. Visualizing Secant Geometrically
While sine and cosine are the vertical and horizontal legs of a right triangle inside the circle, the **secant** can be visualized as a line segment on the **tangent line**:
1.  Draw a tangent line to the circle at the point $(1, 0)$.
2.  Extend the terminal side (the radius) until it hits that tangent line.
3.  The distance from the origin to that intersection point along the terminal side is the **secant length**.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step: From Cosine to Secant
To find $\sec \theta$ for any standard angle:

1.  **Identify the Cosine ($x$):** Look at the x-coordinate of the angle on the unit circle.
2.  **Take the Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction ($x \to 1/x$).
3.  **Rationalize (if necessary):** If the denominator contains a radical, multiply the top and bottom to simplify.

**Example: Finding $\sec(30^\circ)$ or $\sec(\pi/6)$**
* **Step 1:** $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* **Step 2:** $\sec(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}/2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$
* **Step 3:** $\frac{2 \times \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$

---

#### 4. Critical Values and Undefined Points
Secant becomes **undefined** whenever the x-coordinate (cosine) is $0$. This occurs at the top and bottom of the unit circle.

| Angle ($\theta$) | $\cos \theta$ ($x$) | $\sec \theta$ ($1/x$) | Point Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0$ or $0^\circ$ | $1$ | $1/1 = 1$ | Minimum Value |
| $\pi/2$ or $90^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $\pi$ or $180^\circ$ | $-1$ | $1/-1 = -1$ | Maximum Value |
| $3\pi/2$ or $270^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |

---

#### 5. Sign by Quadrant (ASTC)
Since $\sec \theta$ depends entirely on the sign of $x$ (cosine), it follows the same quadrant rules as cosine:
* **Quadrant I:** $x$ is positive $\to \sec \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant II:** $x$ is negative $\to \sec \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant III:** $x$ is negative $\to \sec \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant IV:** $x$ is positive $\to \sec \theta$ is **Positive**
### Finding Cosecant via Sine Reciprocals on the Unit Circle

The cosecant function ($y = \csc \theta$) is the reciprocal of the sine function ($y = \sin \theta$). Just as secant is tied to the horizontal $x$-coordinate, cosecant is tied to the vertical $y$-coordinate on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definition
On the unit circle (radius = 1), every point is defined by $(x, y) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. Since $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$, the value of cosecant at any angle is:
$$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{y}$$

---

#### 2. Visualizing Cosecant Geometrically
Cosecant can be visualized as a line segment related to the **vertical tangent line**:
1. Draw a horizontal tangent line to the circle at the point $(0, 1)$.
2. Extend the terminal side (the radius) until it intersects this horizontal tangent line.
3. The distance from the origin to that intersection point along the terminal side represents the **cosecant length**.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step: From Sine to Cosecant
To find $\csc \theta$ for any standard angle:

1. **Identify the Sine ($y$):** Find the y-coordinate of the angle on the unit circle.
2. **Take the Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction ($y \to 1/y$).
3. **Rationalize (if necessary):** If the denominator contains a radical, multiply the numerator and denominator by that radical.

**Example: Finding $\csc(240^\circ)$ or $\csc(4\pi/3)$**
* **Step 1:** The y-coordinate at $240^\circ$ is $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* **Step 2:** $\csc(240^\circ) = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3}/2} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.
* **Step 3:** $-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

---

#### 4. Critical Values and Undefined Points
Cosecant becomes **undefined** whenever the y-coordinate (sine) is $0$. This occurs at the "sides" of the unit circle (the x-axis).

| Angle ($\theta$) | $\sin \theta$ ($y$) | $\csc \theta$ ($1/y$) | Point Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0$ or $0^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $\pi/2$ or $90^\circ$ | $1$ | $1/1 = 1$ | Minimum Value |
| $\pi$ or $180^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $3\pi/2$ or $270^\circ$ | $-1$ | $1/-1 = -1$ | Maximum Value |


---

#### 5. Sign by Quadrant (ASTC)
Since $\csc \theta$ is the reciprocal of sine, it shares the exact same sign pattern as sine across the four quadrants:
* **Quadrant I:** $y$ is positive (+) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant II:** $y$ is positive (+) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant III:** $y$ is negative (-) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant IV:** $y$ is negative (-) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Negative**

---

#### 6. Summary Comparison for Notes
* **Secant ($1/x$):** Undefined at the top/bottom ($90^\circ, 270^\circ$).
* **Cosecant ($1/y$):** Undefined at the left/right ($0^\circ, 180^\circ$).
* **Both:** Always have values $\geq 1$ or $\leq -1$. They never exist within the "gap" between $-1$ and $1$ because sine and cosine never exceed $1$.
### Using Cosine as a Guide for Graphing Secant

The secant function, $y = \sec(x)$, is the reciprocal of the cosine function, $y = \cos(x)$. Because they are so closely linked, the most accurate way to sketch a secant graph is to first draw a "guide" or "ghost" cosine wave.

---

#### 1. The Reciprocal Relationship
Mathematically, $\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}$. This relationship dictates three critical rules for graphing:
1.  **When $\cos(x) = 1$**, $\sec(x) = 1$.
2.  **When $\cos(x) = -1$**, $\sec(x) = -1$.
3.  **When $\cos(x) = 0$**, $\sec(x)$ is **undefined** (creating a vertical asymptote).

---

#### 2. The 3-Step "Ghost Wave" Method
To graph a transformed secant function like $y = a \sec(b(x-h)) + k$:

##### Step A: Sketch the Ghost Cosine
Sketch the function $y = a \cos(b(x-h)) + k$ using a dashed line or a light color. 
* Identify the **midline** ($y = k$).
* Mark the **peaks** and **valleys** of the wave.

##### Step B: Place Vertical Asymptotes
Draw dashed vertical lines through every point where the cosine guide wave **crosses its midline**.
* In the parent function $y = \cos(x)$, the midline is the x-axis ($y=0$).
* If $\cos(x) = 0$, then $1/0$ is undefined, creating the boundary for the secant curve.

##### Step C: Sketch the Secant "Cups"
The secant graph consists of "U-shaped" curves that share the same vertices as the cosine wave but move in the opposite direction toward the asymptotes.
* **At the Peaks:** Draw a "U" opening **upward** starting from the peak of the cosine wave.
* **At the Valleys:** Draw a "U" opening **downward** starting from the valley of the cosine wave.

| Feature | Cosine Guide ($y = \cos x$) | Secant Result ($y = \sec x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Midline Intercepts** | $(x, k)$ | **Vertical Asymptotes** |
| **Max Points (Peaks)** | $(x, k+a)$ | **Relative Minimums** of the upward "U" |
| **Min Points (Valleys)**| $(x, k-a)$ | **Relative Maximums** of the downward "U" |
| **Period** | $2\pi/b$ | $2\pi/b$ (Same as cosine) |

![[Pasted image 20260113170650.png]]‘Graphing Variations of the Secant Function :
- Replace secant with cosine and sketch the graph using a dashed curve
-  Cosine is used as a guide 
- Sketch the vertical asymptotes
- These occur at 1/4 and 3/4 of the way through the cosine cycle
- Sketch the graph by drawing the u-shaped branches between consecutive vertical asymptotes
- The "hills" and "valleys" are interchanged
- (Optional) Use the period to find additional cycles to the left or right as needed
### Using Sine as a Guide for Graphing Cosecant

The cosecant function, $y = \csc(x)$, is the reciprocal of the sine function, $y = \sin(x)$. To graph it accurately, you first sketch the corresponding sine wave as a "guide."

---

#### 1. The Reciprocal Relationship
Because $\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}$, the behavior of the cosecant graph is entirely dependent on the values of the sine wave:
* **When $\sin(x) = 1$:** $\csc(x) = 1$ (the vertex of the upward curve).
* **When $\sin(x) = -1$:** $\csc(x) = -1$ (the vertex of the downward curve).
* **When $\sin(x) = 0$:** $\csc(x)$ is **undefined**, resulting in a **vertical asymptote**.

---

#### 2. Graphing Steps (The "Ghost" Method)
For a transformed function $y = a \csc(b(x-h)) + k$:

**Step 1: Sketch the Ghost Sine Wave**
Lightly sketch $y = a \sin(b(x-h)) + k$ using a dashed line. 
* Identify the **midline** ($y = k$).
* Mark the five key points of one sine cycle (Start, Quarter, Midpoint, 3/4, End).



**Step 2: Place Vertical Asymptotes**
Draw dashed vertical lines everywhere the ghost sine wave **crosses its midline**. 
* These are the points where the reciprocal becomes $1/0$.



**Step 3: Sketch the Cosecant Curves**
Draw the cosecant "U-shapes" (often called cups) using the peaks and valleys of the sine wave as vertices:
* **At the Peaks:** Draw a "U" opening **upward** toward the asymptotes.
* **At the Valleys:** Draw a "U" opening **downward** toward the asymptotes.
