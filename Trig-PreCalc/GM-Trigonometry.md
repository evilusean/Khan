https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY
- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
- **Right Angle** : Exactly 90 Degrees
- **Obtuse Angle** : Greater than 90 degrees, less than 180 degrees
- **Straight Angle** : 180 degrees
- **Complementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 90 degrees, they are *complementary*
- **Supplementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 180 degrees, they are *supplementary*
## 2026-January-04 - Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=12m10s
- $1\degree$ = $\frac{1}{360}$ : 360 degrees in a circle 
- What happens when you need to measure a rotation that is less than a degree? *Minutes*, and *seconds* are portions/fractions of a degree.
- $125^\circ 30' 45''$ : Standard Notation for *Degrees $\degree$*, *Minutes $'$*, *Seconds $''$* 
- $60'$ = $\frac{1\degree}{60}$ : $60'$ minutes in one degree ($1\degree$)
- $60''$ = $\frac{1'}{60}$ : $60''$ seconds in one minute($1'$)
- $1'' = \frac{1'}{60} = \frac{1\degree}{3600}$ : 1 second is 1/3600th (60 * 60) of a degree
- $37^\circ 15' 45''$ + $19^\circ 50' 17''$  = $57^\circ 6' 2''$ : Once you understand it, you just need to know the carrying process (every 60 seconds is a minute, every 60 minutes is a degree)
- $14^\circ 18' 30''$ - $9^\circ 25' 50''$ = $4\degree 52' 40''$ 
- To find the complement(what adds up to 90 degrees), just borrow from the degrees for the minutes, and borrow from those new minutes for the seconds
- $114.09\degree$ = $114\degree 5' 24''$ : How to go from Decimal form to degrees, minutes and seconds. simply multiply the fractional degree (in this case, '0.09' = 5.4) by 60, then take whatever fractional part is remaining('0.4' * 60 = 24) and multiply that by 60 again for the seconds 
- If you have a TI 83 / 84 : type the number(fractional degrees)  into the calculator look for the **Angle** button, then press **DMS** button and it will convert it for you
- To convert from degrees minutes seconds to a fractional degree, simply divide the *seconds $'$* by '60' and the *minutes* by '3600' then add that to your degrees
## 2026-January-04 - Angles in Standard Position and Coterminal Angles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=24m55s
### Trigonometry: Angles in Standard Position & Coterminal Angles

#### 1. Angles in Standard Position
An angle is in **standard position** when its vertex is at the origin $(0,0)$ of the Cartesian plane and its **initial side** lies along the positive x-axis.

* **Positive Angles:** Measured **counterclockwise** from the initial side.
* **Negative Angles:** Measured **clockwise** from the initial side.
* **Terminal Side:** The ray where the angle measurement ends.
* **Quadrantal Angles:** Angles whose terminal sides lie exactly on an axis ($0^\circ, 90^\circ, 180^\circ, 270^\circ$, etc.).

#### 2. Coterminal Angles
Coterminal angles are angles in standard position that share the same **terminal side**. Although they look the same on a graph, they have different measures because they differ by one or more full rotations.

**Finding Coterminal Angles:**
To find an angle coterminal to a given angle $\theta$, add or subtract multiples of $360^\circ$ (for degrees) or $2\pi$ (for radians).

* **Degrees:** $\theta \pm 360^\circ n$
* **Radians:** $\theta \pm 2\pi n$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Term | Definition | Formula / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Side** | Starting ray of the angle | Always the positive x-axis. |
| **Terminal Side** | Ending ray of the angle | Determines the quadrant. |
| **Positive Angle** | Counterclockwise rotation | Example: $+120^\circ$ |
| **Negative Angle** | Clockwise rotation | Example: $-45^\circ$ |
| **Coterminal** | Different measures, same terminal side | Add/Subtract $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$. |

#### 4. Practice Examples
* **Find a positive coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ + 360^\circ = 405^\circ$
* **Find a negative coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ - 360^\circ = -315^\circ$
* **Find the smallest positive coterminal angle for $\frac{13\pi}{4}$:**
    $\frac{13\pi}{4} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$
## 2026-January-05 - Angles Relationship and Similar Triangles :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=34m30s
### Vertical Angles :
- **Vertical Angles** : Angles that are opposite eachother where the 2 lines cross - The opposite side angles will be the same equal measures
![[Pasted image 20260105142242.png]]
- 1 and 3 are opposites and will be the same
- 2 and 4 are opposites and will be the same
- 1 and 2 are supplementary angles and will add up to 180 degrees
- 3 and 4 are supplementary as well and will also add up to 180 degrees
### Transversal intersects 2 parallel Lines : 
![[Pasted image 20260105142125.png]]
- **Interior Angles** Are the angles on the interior of the parallel lines
- **Alternate Interior Angles** : are angles that will have equal measures (3 and 6, 5 and 4)
- 3 and 6 will be the equal angle measurements
- 4 and 5 will be the equal angle measurements
- **Exterior Angles** : Are the angles outside the interior parallel lines
- **Alternate Exterior Angles** : Alternate Exterior Angles will have exterior measures (1 and 8, 2 and 7)
- 2 and 7 will be the equal angle measurements
- 1 and 8 will be the equal angle measurements
- Since 7 and 8 are supplementary angles(add up to 180), and 2 = 7 : 
  7 :$(11x-53)\degree$
  8 : $(4x+8)\degree$ 
  7+ 8 : $11x -53 +4x + 8 = 180\degree$
  15x - 45 = 180
  15x = 225
  x = 15 
  Plug x into the angles to get their measurement 
  2 and 7 :  $(11x-53)\degree$ : 11(15) - 53 : 165 - 53 : $112\degree$
  1 and 8 :  $(4x+8)\degree$ : 4(15) + 8 : $68\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so : 7, 6, 2, 3 = $112\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so 1, 4, 5 , 8 = $68\degree$ 
### Triangle Sum 180
![[Pasted image 20260105144919.png]]
- The sum of the measure of any triangle will always be 180 degrees
- 6x + 1 + 10x - 56 + 43 = 180 : 16x -12 = 180 : 16x  = 192 : x = 12
- Plug 12 into x for the other 2 angles :
  1: 6(12) + 1 : $73\degree$ 
  2: 10(12) - 56 : $64\degree$ 
  3 : $43\degree$ 
  Check : $73\degree + 64\degree + 43\degree = 180\degree$ 
### Similar Triangles :
![[Pasted image 20260105145810.png]]
- Similar Triangles Must have the same measure of angles 
- corresponding angles must have same measures
- So A = D, F = C, E = B
  A and  D = $18\degree$ 
  F and C = $144\degree$ 
  All triangles add up to 180 degrees :
  B and E = $180\degree - 144\degree - 18\degree = 18\degree$
### Similar Triangles, Missing Side Lengths :
![[Pasted image 20260105150638.png]]
- Since the length of side BA and ED are the same angles, and the length is 15 on BA and 30 on ED (doubled) the similar triangles are just double the size for triangle EDF, so just double the size of the sides :
  $\triangle ABC$ ~  $\triangle DEF$ : Triangle ABC is similar(~) to Triangle DEF
  BA = 15 :   ED = 30
  AC = 24 :   DF = 48
  BC = 30.5 :   EF = 61
- For similar triangles : Corresponding Sides must be equal, and corresponding sides must be *proportional*
## 2026-January-05 - Trigonometric Functions :

### Trigonometric Values for the Point $(9, -9)$

To find the six trigonometric functions for the point $(x, y) = (9, -9)$, we first determine the distance from the origin $r$.

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
Using the distance formula simplified for the origin:

#### Calculating the Radius ($r$)
* $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2}$
* $r = \sqrt{9 + 9}$
* $r = \sqrt{18}$
* $r = 3\sqrt{2}$

#### The Six Trigonometric Functions

## 2026-January-06 - Reciprocal Identities, Signs of Trigonometric Function Values, Finding Missing Function Values :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h5m30s
- **SOH-CAH-TOA** (Sine=Opposite(y) over Hypoteneuse(r), Cosine = Adjacent(x) over Hypoteneuse(r), Tangent = Opposite(y) over Adjacent(x))
- **Recipricoals** : Sine+Cosecant(S with C) - Cosine+Secant(C with S) - Tangent+CoTangent (Tan with Tan)
- If you know one(like sine), you automatically know the other(its reciprocal, Cosecant) by simply flipping the fraction.
- 
### Why To use Trig Functions? Practical Use? 
- You know **one angle** (besides the 90°) and **one side** → find everything else.
- You know **two sides** → find all angles and the remaining side.
In a **right triangle**, you always have one 90° angle. To determine the entire triangle (all sides and both acute angles), you need **any two** of the following three pieces:
1. One acute angle + one side (any side)
2. Two sides (any two of the three sides)
Key rule: In a right triangle, any 2 pieces (excluding knowing just the right angle) are enough to find everything else.
### Trig Functions with Reciprocals :
- **sin θ** = y / r  → 
  **csc θ** = r / y (y ≠ 0)
- **cos θ** = x / r → 
  **sec θ** = r / x (x ≠ 0)
- **tan θ** = y / x (x ≠ 0) → 
  **cot θ** = x / y (y ≠ 0)
### Reciprocal Identities

These identities define the relationship between the primary trigonometric functions and their reciprocal counterparts.

* $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta}$
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$
* $\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta}$
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$
* $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$

#### Quotient Identities
In addition to the reciprocal values, these functions can be expressed as ratios of sine and cosine:

* $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant
![[Pasted image 20260106151753.png]]
The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$.

#### 1. Quadrant Sign Analysis
The signs are derived from the coordinates in each quadrant, where $r$ (the radius) is always positive:
* **Quadrant I:** $x > 0, y > 0$. All ratios are positive.
* **Quadrant II:** $x < 0, y > 0$. Only $\sin \theta$ and $\csc \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant III:** $x < 0, y < 0$. Only $\tan \theta$ and $\cot \theta$ are positive.
* **Quadrant IV:** $x > 0, y < 0$. Only $\cos \theta$ and $\sec \theta$ are positive.

#### 2. Trigonometric Sign Table
| Quadrant | $\sin \theta$ | $\cos \theta$ | $\tan \theta$ | $\cot \theta$ | $\sec \theta$ | $\csc \theta$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **I** | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **III** | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **IV** | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Definitions of the 6 Functions
The signs in the table above are based on these fundamental ratios:
* $\sin \theta = y/r$
* $\cos \theta = x/r$
* $\tan \theta = y/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\csc \theta = r/y, (y \neq 0)$
* $\sec \theta = r/x, (x \neq 0)$
* $\cot \theta = x/y, (y \neq 0)$
### Signs of Trigonometric Functions by Quadrant

The sign (positive or negative) of a trigonometric function is determined by the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the terminal side of the angle $\theta$. 

* **$x$ is positive** in Quadrants I and IV.
* **$y$ is positive** in Quadrants I and II.
* **$r$ (radius)** is always positive.

#### 1. The "All Students Take Calculus" Mnemonic
A common way to remember which functions are **positive** in each quadrant:
* **A**ll (Quadrant I): **A**ll functions are positive.
* **S**tudents (Quadrant II): **S**ine (and cosecant) are positive.
* **T**ake (Quadrant III): **T**angent (and cotangent) are positive.
* **C**alculus (Quadrant IV): **C**osine (and secant) are positive.

#### 2. Quadrant Sign Table

| Quadrant | $\sin$ / $\csc$ ($y$) | $\cos$ / $\sec$ ($x$) | $\tan$ / $\cot$ ($y/x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| **II** ($90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$) | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| **III** ($180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$) | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| **IV** ($270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$) | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |

#### 3. Detailed Breakdown
* **Quadrant I (All $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are positive. Every ratio is positive.
* **Quadrant II (Sine $+$):** $y$ is positive, but $x$ is negative. Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, it remains positive. $\cos \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $x$, so they are negative.
* **Quadrant III (Tangent $+$):** Both $x$ and $y$ are negative. $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ are negative, but $\tan \theta = y/x$ becomes positive (negative divided by negative).
* **Quadrant IV (Cosine $+$):** $x$ is positive, but $y$ is negative. Since $\cos \theta = x/r$, it remains positive. $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ involve $y$, so they are negative.

### Solving for Cosine using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the secant function, we can find the cosine value using the reciprocal relationship between the two.

#### Given

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta}$



#### Solution
1. Substitute the given value into the formula:
   $$\cos \theta = \frac{1}{9/2}$$
2. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
   $$\cos \theta = 1 \cdot \frac{2}{9}$$
3. Result:
   **$\cos \theta = \frac{2}{9}$**

#### Quick Reference
| Known Function              | Reciprocal                  | Method            |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| $\sec \theta = \frac{a}{b}$ | $\cos \theta = \frac{b}{a}$ | Flip the fraction |
### Solving for Cosecant using Reciprocal Identities

Given the value of the sine function, we can find the cosecant value using their reciprocal relationship.

#### Given
* $\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$

#### Formula
Using the reciprocal identity:
* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$

#### Solution
1. **Substitute the given value:**
   $$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}}$$

2. **Multiply by the reciprocal:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{6}}$$

3. **Rationalize the denominator:**
   $$\csc \theta = -\frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{6}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{6}}{6}$$

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**

#### Quick Summary
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{6}}{3}$**
* **$\csc \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$**
### Determining Quadrants using ASTC

To find the quadrant where $\cos \theta > 0$ and $\csc \theta < 0$, we analyze the signs of the trigonometric functions based on the **All Students Take Calculus** mnemonic.

#### 1. Analyze the Given Conditions
* **Condition 1: $\cos \theta > 0$ (Positive)**
    * According to **ASTC**, Cosine is positive in **Quadrant I** (All) and **Quadrant IV** (Calculus).
* **Condition 2: $\csc \theta < 0$ (Negative)**
    * Since $\csc \theta$ is the reciprocal of $\sin \theta$, it has the same sign as sine. 
    * Sine is positive in Quadrants I and II, so it is **negative** in **Quadrant III** and **Quadrant IV**.

#### 2. Find the Overlap
To satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we look for the quadrant common to both lists:
* $\cos \theta$ is positive in: {I, **IV**}
* $\csc \theta$ is negative in: {III, **IV**}

**Result:** The angle $\theta$ must lie in **Quadrant IV**.

#### 3. Quick Reference Summary
| Function Sign                             | Possible Quadrants |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| $\cos \theta > 0$                         | I, IV              |
| $\sin \theta < 0$ (same as $\csc \theta$) | III, IV            |
| **Intersection**                          | **Quadrant IV**    |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = 110^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for $110^\circ$, we first locate which quadrant the angle falls into and then apply the **ASTC (All Students Take Calculus)** rule.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Angle:** $110^\circ$
* **Boundary:** Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant II**.
#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant II** ("Students"):
* **Sine ($\sin$)** and its reciprocal **Cosecant ($\csc$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $110^\circ$

| $\cot 110^\circ$ | **$-$** | $x/y$ (Negative / Positive) |
### Determining Signs for $\theta = -150^\circ$

To determine the signs of the six trigonometric functions for a negative angle, we first find its position on the coordinate plane or identify its positive coterminal equivalent.

#### 1. Locate the Quadrant
* **Rotation:** Starting from the positive x-axis, rotate **clockwise** $150^\circ$.
* **Coterminal Angle:** $-150^\circ + 360^\circ = 210^\circ$.
* **Boundary:** Since $180^\circ < 210^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 2. Apply ASTC Mnemonic
In **Quadrant III** ("Take"):
* **Tangent ($\tan$)** and its reciprocal **Cotangent ($\cot$)** are **Positive (+)**.
* **All other functions** (Sine, Cosine, Cosecant, Secant) are **Negative (-)**.

#### 3. Summary of Signs for $-150^\circ$

### Determining Trigonometric Components for $\sec \theta = 19/11$ and $\sin \theta < 0$

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
To determine the quadrant, we analyze the signs of the given functions:
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$ (Positive). Since $\sec \theta = r/x$, $x$ must be positive. This occurs in **Quadrants I and IV**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Since $\sin \theta = y/r$, $y$ must be negative. This occurs in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side is located in **Quadrant IV**.


#### 2. Solve for $r$ and $x$
Using the definition of the secant function from the provided image:
* **Formula:** $\sec \theta = r/x$
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = 19/11$
* **Identification:** * $r = 19$
    * $x = 11$

#### 3. Solve for $y$
Using the Pythagorean relationship $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:
* $11^2 + y^2 = 19^2$
* $121 + y^2 = 361$
* $y^2 = 361 - 121$
* $y^2 = 240$
* $y = \pm\sqrt{240} = \pm 4\sqrt{15}$

**Final Value for $y$:** Because the angle is in **Quadrant IV**, $y$ must be negative:
* **$y = -4\sqrt{15}$**

### Pythagorean Identities

The **Pythagorean Identities** are fundamental equations in trigonometry derived from the Pythagorean Theorem ($x^2 + y^2 = r^2$) as applied to the unit circle. These identities allow you to find the value of one trigonometric function when another is known.
#### 1. Primary Identities
Based on your course materials, here are the three core Pythagorean identities:

* **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**
* **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$**
* **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$**
#### 2. Derivation and Logic
These formulas are built upon the definitions of trigonometric functions in terms of $x$, $y$, and $r$:
* **Sine ($\sin \theta$):** $y/r$
* **Cosine ($\cos \theta$):** $x/r$
* **Tangent ($\tan \theta$):** $y/x$

If you divide the primary identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$) by $\cos^2 \theta$, you arrive at the second identity involving tangent and secant. Similarly, dividing by $\sin^2 \theta$ results in the third identity involving cotangent and cosecant.
#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Identity | Primary Functions Involved | Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$** | Sine, Cosine | Converting between $\sin$ and $\cos$. |
| **$\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$** | Tangent, Secant | Finding $\sec$ if $\tan$ is known. |
| **$1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$** | Cotangent, Cosecant | Finding $\csc$ if $\cot$ is known. |
### Deriving the Three Pythagorean Identities

The Pythagorean identities are derived by taking the Pythagorean theorem equation, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, and dividing each term by $r^2$, $x^2$, or $y^2$.

#### 1. Identity for $\sin$ and $\cos$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$r^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{r^2} + \frac{y^2}{r^2} = \frac{r^2}{r^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{r})^2 + (\frac{y}{r})^2 = 1$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$ and $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$:
* **Result:** $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$ (or **$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$**)

#### 2. Identity for $\tan$ and $\sec$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$x^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{x^2} + \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{r^2}{x^2}$
* **Simplify:** $1 + (\frac{y}{x})^2 = (\frac{r}{x})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$ and $\sec \theta = \frac{r}{x}$:
* **Result:** **$1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta$**

#### 3. Identity for $\cot$ and $\csc$
To get this identity, divide $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ by **$y^2$**:
* **Equation:** $\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{y^2} = \frac{r^2}{y^2}$
* **Simplify:** $(\frac{x}{y})^2 + 1 = (\frac{r}{y})^2$
* **Substitute:** Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$ and $\csc \theta = \frac{r}{y}$:
* **Result:** **$\cot^2 \theta + 1 = \csc^2 \theta$**
### Quotient Identities

Quotient identities express trigonometric functions as the ratio of two other trigonometric functions. In PreCalculus, there are two primary quotient identities involving tangent and cotangent.

#### 1. The Identities
* **Tangent Identity**: $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
* **Cotangent Identity**: $\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$

#### 2. Derivation of the Tangent Identity
To derive the tangent identity, we use the definitions of sine and cosine in terms of $x, y,$ and $r$:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Sine over Cosine:
    $$\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{y/r}{x/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify the complex fraction by multiplying by the reciprocal:
    $$\frac{y}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{x} = \frac{y}{x}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$, we conclude that **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$**.

#### 3. Derivation of the Cotangent Identity
The cotangent identity is derived similarly or by using the reciprocal property of tangent:

* **Step 1**: Recall the definitions:
    * $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
    * $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
* **Step 2**: Create a ratio of Cosine over Sine:
    $$\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x/r}{y/r}$$
* **Step 3**: Simplify:
    $$\frac{x}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{y} = \frac{x}{y}$$
* **Step 4**: Identify the result:
    * Since $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$, we conclude that **$\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$**.

#### 4. Summary for Obsidian
| Identity      | Ratio                             | Reciprocal Relationship |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Tangent**   | $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\cot \theta}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$ | $\frac{1}{\tan \theta}$ |
### Ranges of Trigonometric Function Values

The **range** of a trigonometric function is the set of all possible output values ($y$-values). These ranges are determined by the relationships between $x, y,$ and $r$ (the radius) on the coordinate plane.

#### 1. Range of Sine and Cosine
For any point on a circle, the horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) distances can never exceed the radius ($r$).
* **Sine**: Since $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $|y| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Cosine**: Since $\cos \theta = x/r$ and $|x| \leq r$, the value must stay between $-1$ and $1$.
* **Range**: $[-1, 1]$
* **Inequality**: $-1 \leq \sin \theta \leq 1$ and $-1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1$

#### 2. Range of Cosecant and Secant
Since these are the reciprocals of sine and cosine, their values are always "outside" the $[-1, 1]$ interval. They can never be a proper fraction like $1/2$ or $-1/2$.
* **Cosecant**: $\csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta$. If $\sin \theta$ is small, $\csc \theta$ is large.
* **Secant**: $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$. If $\cos \theta$ is small, $\sec \theta$ is large.
* **Range**: $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: $\csc \theta \leq -1$ or $\csc \theta \geq 1$; $\sec \theta \leq -1$ or $\sec \theta \geq 1$

#### 3. Range of Tangent and Cotangent
Tangent and cotangent are ratios of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ can be much larger than $y$, or $y$ can be much larger than $x$, these ratios can result in any real number.
* **Tangent**: $\tan \theta = y/x$
* **Cotangent**: $\cot \theta = x/y$
* **Range**: $(-\infty, \infty)$
* **Inequality**: All real numbers.

#### 4. Range Summary Table

| Function | Range (Interval Notation) | Range (Inequality) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $[-1, 1]$ | $-1 \leq \text{value} \leq 1$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\cot \theta$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | All Real Numbers |
| **$\sec \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
| **$\csc \theta$** | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ | $\text{value} \leq -1$ or $\text{value} \geq 1$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ from $\tan \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find the exact values of the remaining trigonometric functions, we analyze the given ratio and the quadrant determined by the signs of the functions.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\tan \theta = \frac{7}{3}$ (Positive). Tangent is positive in **Quadrants I and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:
* Since the ratio is $7/3$ and we are in Quadrant III, we assign the negative values:
    * **$y = -7$**
    * **$x = -3$**
* Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius ($r$):
    * $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-7)^2}$
    * $r = \sqrt{9 + 49}$
    * **$r = \sqrt{58}$**

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-7}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{58}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)         |
| **$x$**           | $-3$                     |
| **$y$**           | $-7$                     |
| **$r$**           | $\sqrt{58}$              |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{7\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
| **$\cos \theta$** | $-\frac{3\sqrt{58}}{58}$ |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\sec \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these exact values, we identify the quadrant based on the given signs and then calculate the missing coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\sec \theta = -2$ (Negative). Since $\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$, cosine is also negative. Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\cot \theta > 0$ (Positive). Cotangent is positive where tangent is positive, which occurs in **Quadrants I and III**.

**Result:** To satisfy both conditions, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\sec \theta = r/x$:
* **Given:** $\sec \theta = -2$, which can be written as $2/-1$.
* **Radius ($r$):** Must be positive, so **$r = 2$**.
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** Must be **$-1$**.
* **Solve for $y$:**
    * $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
    * $(-1)^2 + y^2 = 2^2$
    * $1 + y^2 = 4$
    * $y^2 = 3$
    * $y = \pm\sqrt{3}$
* **Determine Sign:** Since we are in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -\sqrt{3}$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y/r$ and $\tan \theta = y/x$:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{-1} = \sqrt{3}$**

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Component         | Value                 |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Quadrant**      | III ($x<0, y<0$)      |
| **$x$**           | $-1$                  |
| **$y$**           | $-\sqrt{3}$           |
| **$r$**           | $2$                   |
| **$\sin \theta$** | $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| **$\tan \theta$** | $\sqrt{3}$            |
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ from $\cos \theta$ and Sign Conditions

To find these trigonometric values, we determine the quadrant based on the signs of the functions and then calculate the missing $y$-coordinate and radius.

#### 1. Identify the Quadrant
* **Condition 1:** $\cos \theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$ (Negative). Cosine is negative in **Quadrants II and III**.
* **Condition 2:** $\sin \theta < 0$ (Negative). Sine is negative in **Quadrants III and IV**.

**Result:** The terminal side of the angle lies in **Quadrant III**. In this quadrant, both $x$ and $y$ are negative.

#### 2. Identify $x$, $y$, and $r$
Using the definition $\cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$:
* **Given:** $\cos \theta = \frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{3}$
* **Radius ($r$):** $r = 3$
* **x-coordinate ($x$):** $x = -2\sqrt{2}$
* **Solve for $y$ using $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$:**
    * $(-2\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = 3^2$
    * $8 + y^2 = 9$
    * $y^2 = 1$
    * $y = \pm 1$
* **Determine Sign:** Since the angle is in **Quadrant III**, $y$ must be negative: **$y = -1$**.

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$ and $\tan \theta$
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$ and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:

* **$\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{3}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{-1}{-2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$**
    * Rationalizing the denominator: $\frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$
    * **$\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$**

#### Summary Table
| Component         | Value                |

## 2026-January-08 - Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles | Cofunction Identities :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=1h46m30s
### Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles

Trigonometric functions of acute angles ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) are defined by the ratios of the sides of a right triangle. These are often remembered using the mnemonic **SOH CAH TOA**.

#### 1. Right Triangle Definitions
In a right triangle, we identify three sides relative to an acute angle $\theta$:
* **Opposite**: The side across from angle $\theta$.
* **Adjacent**: The side next to angle $\theta$ (that is not the hypotenuse).
* **Hypotenuse**: The longest side, opposite the right angle.

#### 2. The Six Trigonometric Ratios
The functions are defined as follows:

* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (SOH)
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$** (CAH)
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (TOA)

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Sine)
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}}$** (Reciprocal of Cosine)
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}}$** (Reciprocal of Tangent)

#### 3. Cofunction Identities
Acute angles in a right triangle are complementary ($\theta$ and $90^\circ - \theta$). This leads to cofunction identities where a function of an angle is equal to the cofunction of its complement:
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function      | Abbreviation | Ratio                     |
| :------------ | :----------- | :------------------------ |
| **Sine**      | $\sin$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Cosine**    | $\cos$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Hyp}$ |
| **Tangent**   | $\tan$       | $\text{Opp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cosecant**  | $\csc$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Opp}$ |
| **Secant**    | $\sec$       | $\text{Hyp} / \text{Adj}$ |
| **Cotangent** | $\cot$       | $\text{Adj} / \text{Opp}$ |
### Cofunction Identities

Cofunction identities describe the relationship between trigonometric functions of complementary angles. In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary, meaning they sum to $90^\circ$ (or $\pi/2$ radians).

#### 1. The Core Concept
A trigonometric function of an acute angle $\theta$ is equal to the **cofunction** of its complement. This means the value of a function at $\theta$ is the same as the value of its "co-" partner at $90^\circ - \theta$.

#### 2. List of Cofunction Identities
These identities apply to the three pairs of cofunctions:

**Sine and Cosine**
* $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Tangent and Cotangent**
* $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)$

**Secant and Cosecant**
* $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$
* $\csc \theta = \sec(90^\circ - \theta)$

#### 3. Derivation Logic
In a right triangle with acute angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
* $\sin \alpha = \frac{\text{Opposite to } \alpha}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* $\cos \beta = \frac{\text{Adjacent to } \beta}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
Since the side opposite to $\alpha$ is the same side that is adjacent to $\beta$, and $\beta = 90^\circ - \alpha$, it follows that $\sin \alpha = \cos(90^\circ - \alpha)$.

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function    | Cofunction | Identity (Degrees)                      |
| :---------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Sine**    | Cosine     | $\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Tangent** | Cotangent  | $\tan \theta = \cot(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
| **Secant**  | Cosecant   | $\sec \theta = \csc(90^\circ - \theta)$ |
### Finding the 6 Trigonometric Functions for a Right Triangle

Based on the provided right triangle image, we can find the values of the six trigonometric functions for the angle $\theta$ using the side lengths provided.

#### 1. Identify the Sides
From the triangle in the image:
* **Opposite side** (across from $\theta$): $2$
* **Adjacent side** (next to $\theta$): $4$
* **Hypotenuse** (opposite the right angle): $2\sqrt{5}$

#### 2. Calculate the 6 Functions
Using the standard ratios for a right triangle:

**Primary Functions:**
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$**
    * Rationalized: **$\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$**

**Reciprocal Functions:**
* **$\csc \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}$**
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$**
* **$\cot \theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$**

#### 3. Summary Table
| Function | Exact Ratio | Simplified/Rationalized |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| $\sin \theta$ | $2 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\cos \theta$ | $4 / 2\sqrt{5}$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 5$ |
| $\tan \theta$ | $2 / 4$ | $1 / 2$ |
| $\csc \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 2$ | $\sqrt{5}$ |
| $\sec \theta$ | $2\sqrt{5} / 4$ | $\sqrt{5} / 2$ |
| $\cot \theta$ | $4 / 2$ | $2$ |
### Solving for $\theta$ Using Cofunction Identities

The problem from the image asks to solve the equation:
$$\sin(2\theta + 20^\circ) = \cos(3\theta + 5^\circ)$$

#### 1. Core Concept
According to the **Cofunction Identities**, the sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Therefore, if $\sin(A) = \cos(B)$, then the sum of the two angles must be $90^\circ$:
* $A + B = 90^\circ$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Solution
Based on the equation provided in the image:
* **Identify Angles**: Let $A = 2\theta + 20^\circ$ and $B = 3\theta + 5^\circ$.
* **Set up Equation**: $(2\theta + 20^\circ) + (3\theta + 5^\circ) = 90^\circ$
* **Combine Like Terms**: $5\theta + 25^\circ = 90^\circ$
* **Isolate $\theta$ Term**: 
    * $5\theta = 90^\circ - 25^\circ$
    * $5\theta = 65^\circ$
* **Solve for $\theta$**:
    * $\theta = \frac{65^\circ}{5}$
    * **$\theta = 13^\circ$**

#### 3. Final Answer
The value of $\theta$ that satisfies the equation is **$13^\circ$**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h6m
### Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles

To find the trigonometric functions of angles that are not acute (angles outside the range $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$), we use the concepts of **Reference Angles** and the **ASTC Rule**.

#### 1. Reference Angles ($\theta'$)
A reference angle is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**.

* **Quadrant I**: $\theta' = \theta$
* **Quadrant II**: $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ (or $\pi - \theta$)
* **Quadrant III**: $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ (or $\theta - \pi$)
* **Quadrant IV**: $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ (or $2\pi - \theta$)

#### 2. Determining Signs (ASTC Rule)
The sign (positive or negative) of the function depends on the quadrant where the terminal side lies:

* **Quadrant I (All)**: All functions are **positive**.
* **Quadrant II (Students)**: **Sine** and its reciprocal **Cosecant** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant III (Take)**: **Tangent** and its reciprocal **Cotangent** are **positive**.
* **Quadrant IV (Calculus)**: **Cosine** and its reciprocal **Secant** are **positive**.

#### 3. Procedure for Evaluation
To evaluate a trigonometric function for any non-acute angle:
1.  **Find the reference angle** ($\theta'$).
2.  **Determine the sign** based on the original angle's quadrant.
3.  **Evaluate the function** for the reference angle and apply the sign.
    * Example: $\cos(210^\circ)$
    * $\theta' = 210^\circ - 180^\circ = 30^\circ$
    * $210^\circ$ is in QIII, so Cosine is negative.
    * $\cos(210^\circ) = -\cos(30^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

#### 4. Summary Table
| Quadrant | Reference Angle                | Positive Functions |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **I**    | $\theta' = \theta$             | All                |
| **II**   | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ | $\sin, \csc$       |
| **III**  | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ | $\tan, \cot$       |
| **IV**   | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ | $\cos, \sec$       |
### Reference Angles ($\theta'$)

A **reference angle** is the positive acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ and the **x-axis**. Reference angles allow us to simplify the evaluation of trigonometric functions for any non-acute angle by relating them back to angles in the first quadrant.

#### 1. Key Characteristics
* **Always Acute**: The value is always between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ ($0$ and $\pi/2$ radians).
* **Always Positive**: Reference angles are absolute measures of rotation from the x-axis.
* **X-Axis Only**: They are never measured from the y-axis.

#### 2. Calculating Reference Angles by Quadrant
The formula used to find the reference angle ($\theta'$) depends on the quadrant in which the terminal side of the original angle ($\theta$) lies:

| Quadrant | Location of $\theta$ | Reference Angle Formula ($\theta'$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quadrant I** | $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta$ |
| **Quadrant II** | $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$ | $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$ |
| **Quadrant III** | $180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$ | $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$ |
| **Quadrant IV** | $270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$ | $\theta' = 360^\circ - \theta$ |

#### 3. Steps to Find a Reference Angle
1.  **Identify the Quadrant**: Determine where the terminal side of the angle $\theta$ sits.
2.  **Adjust for Coterminality**: If the angle is greater than $360^\circ$ or less than $0^\circ$, find a coterminal angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ first.
3.  **Apply Formula**: Use the quadrant-specific subtraction rule shown above.

#### 4. Examples
* **Example 1 ($150^\circ$)**: Lies in QII. $\theta' = 180^\circ - 150^\circ = \mathbf{30^\circ}$.
* **Example 2 ($225^\circ$)**: Lies in QIII. $\theta' = 225^\circ - 180^\circ = \mathbf{45^\circ}$.
* **Example 3 ($-60^\circ$)**: Coterminal with $300^\circ$ (QIV). $\theta' = 360^\circ - 300^\circ = \mathbf{60^\circ}$.
### Trigonometric Function Values of Special Angles

Special angles—$30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$—are derived from two specific right triangles: the **45-45-90** triangle and the **30-60-90** triangle. These triangles provide exact values for trigonometric functions that are used throughout Calculus and Physics.

### Using Reference Angles to Find Trigonometric Values

The "use case" of a reference angle is that it allows us to create a right triangle (often called a **reference triangle**) in any quadrant. Even though $150^\circ$ is too "wide" to fit inside a right triangle, its reference angle of $30^\circ$ fits perfectly.

#### 1. Visualizing the Reference Triangle
When you draw an angle of $150^\circ$ in standard position, the terminal side sits in **Quadrant II**. To create a triangle:
1.  Drop a perpendicular line from any point on the terminal side down to the **x-axis**.
2.  The "gap" between that terminal side and the negative x-axis is your reference angle ($180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ$).
3.  This forms a right triangle where the horizontal leg is on the x-axis and the vertical leg is the height.
#### 2. Assigning Values to the Triangle
Since the reference angle is $30^\circ$, we use the side ratios of a standard **30-60-90 triangle** ($1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$). However, we must apply the correct signs based on the quadrant:
* **Opposite ($y$):** $1$ (Positive, because it goes up in QII)
* **Adjacent ($x$):** $-\sqrt{3}$ (Negative, because it goes left in QII)
* **Hypotenuse ($r$):** $2$ (Always positive)

#### 3. Calculating the Values for $150^\circ$
Now, you simply use the ratios from this "drawn" triangle. The trig values for $150^\circ$ are identical to the values for $30^\circ$, just with the signs adjusted for Quadrant II:

* **$\sin(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{1}{2}$** (Positive in QII)
* **$\cos(150^\circ) = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$** (Negative in QII)
* **$\tan(150^\circ) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$** (Negative in QII)

#### 4. Why Use the Reference Angle?
The reference angle is a shortcut. Instead of memorizing every single angle on the unit circle, you only need to know the values for $30^\circ, 45^\circ,$ and $60^\circ$. 

**The Rule:**
$$\text{Trig Function}(\theta) = \pm \text{Trig Function}(\theta')$$
You find the value using the acute reference angle ($\theta'$), and then you use the **ASTC rule** to decide if the result should be positive or negative based on the original angle's quadrant.
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = -250^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for a negative angle, we first find its positive coterminal equivalent between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ and then apply the quadrant-specific formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Add $360^\circ$ to the negative angle to find its position in standard position:
* $-250^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{110^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $90^\circ < 110^\circ < 180^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant II**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant II, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$:
* $\theta' = 180^\circ - 110^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 70^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $-250^\circ$   |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $110^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | II             |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$70^\circ$** |
### Finding the Reference Angle for $\theta = 560^\circ$

To find the reference angle ($\theta'$) for an angle greater than $360^\circ$, we first find its coterminal equivalent within one full rotation and then apply the appropriate quadrant formula.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from the original angle to find its position within the first rotation ($0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$):
* $560^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{200^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify the Quadrant
* Since $180^\circ < 200^\circ < 270^\circ$, the terminal side lies in **Quadrant III**.

#### 3. Apply the Reference Angle Formula
For Quadrant III, the formula is $\theta' = \theta - 180^\circ$:
* $\theta' = 200^\circ - 180^\circ$
* **$\theta' = 20^\circ$**

#### Summary Table
| Step                            | Value          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Original Angle ($\theta$)**   | $560^\circ$    |
| **Coterminal Angle**            | $200^\circ$    |
| **Quadrant**                    | III            |
| **Reference Angle ($\theta'$)** | **$20^\circ$** |
### Evaluating $\cos(-600^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To evaluate the trigonometric value of an angle outside the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range, we follow a three-step process: find a coterminal angle, determine the reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on the quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
First, we add multiples of $360^\circ$ to $-600^\circ$ to find an equivalent angle within the first positive rotation:
* $-600^\circ + 360^\circ = -240^\circ$
* $-240^\circ + 360^\circ = \mathbf{120^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $120^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 120^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 60^\circ$**

#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: According to the ASTC rule, **Cosine is negative** in Quadrant II.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\cos(-600^\circ) = \cos(120^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\cos(60^\circ)$$
$$\cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step                 | Value                   |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Original Angle**   | $-600^\circ$            |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $120^\circ$             |
| **Quadrant**         | II (Cosine is negative) |
| **Reference Angle**  | $60^\circ$              |
| **Final Value**      | **$-1/2$**              |
### Evaluating $\sec(495^\circ)$ Using Reference Angles

To find the exact value of $\sec(495^\circ)$, we simplify the angle into the first rotation, find its reference angle, and apply the correct sign based on its quadrant.

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Subtract $360^\circ$ from $495^\circ$ to find the equivalent angle within the standard $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ range:
* $495^\circ - 360^\circ = \mathbf{135^\circ}$

#### 2. Identify Quadrant and Reference Angle ($\theta'$)
* **Quadrant**: $135^\circ$ lies between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, so the terminal side is in **Quadrant II**.
* **Reference Angle**: In QII, the formula is $\theta' = 180^\circ - \theta$.
    * $\theta' = 180^\circ - 135^\circ$
    * **$\theta' = 45^\circ$**



#### 3. Determine the Sign and Evaluate
* **Sign**: In Quadrant II, only Sine and Cosecant are positive. Therefore, **Secant is negative**.
* **Special Value**: Recall that $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its reciprocal $\sec(45^\circ) = \sqrt{2}$.

**Calculation**:
$$\sec(495^\circ) = \sec(135^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sec(45^\circ)$$
$$\sec(135^\circ) = -\sqrt{2}$$

#### Summary Table
| Step                 | Value                   |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Original Angle**   | $495^\circ$             |
| **Coterminal Angle** | $135^\circ$             |
| **Quadrant**         | II (Secant is negative) |
| **Reference Angle**  | $45^\circ$              |
| **Final Value**      | **$-\sqrt{2}$**         |

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h26m35s
### Finding Trigonometric Function Values Using a Calculator

When exact values (like $\sqrt{3}/2$) are not required or when dealing with non-special angles, calculators are used to find decimal approximations.

#### 1. Setting the Correct Mode
Before performing any calculations, you must ensure your calculator is in the correct mode for the angle unit you are using. Entering a degree value while in radian mode (or vice versa) will result in an incorrect answer.
* **Degree Mode ($^\circ$):** Use this when your angle is given in degrees (e.g., $30^\circ$).
* **Radian Mode:** Use this when your angle is in radians (e.g., $\pi/6$ or $0.5$).

#### 2. Evaluating Primary Functions ($\sin, \cos, \tan$)
Most scientific and graphing calculators have dedicated buttons for these:
* **Steps:** Press the function key (e.g., `SIN`), enter the angle value, and press `ENTER` or =.
* **Example:** To find $\sin(46^\circ)$, ensure you are in degree mode and input `SIN(46)`.

#### 3. Evaluating Reciprocal Functions ($\csc, \sec, \cot$)
Calculators typically do NOT have dedicated buttons for these. You must use their reciprocal identities:
* **Cosecant:** $\csc \theta = 1 / \sin \theta$
* **Secant:** $\sec \theta = 1 / \cos \theta$
* **Cotangent:** $\cot \theta = 1 / \tan \theta$
* **Calculator Input:** To find $\sec(45^\circ)$, you would input `1 / COS(45)`.

#### 4. Inverse Trigonometric Functions
To find an angle $\theta$ when you know the value (e.g., $\sin \theta = 0.5$), use the inverse functions:
* **Buttons:** Usually labeled as $\sin^{-1}$, $\cos^{-1}$, and $\tan^{-1}$ (often accessed via a `2nd` or `SHIFT` key).
* **The Result:** The calculator returns the **principal angle**. For example, `SIN⁻¹(0.5)` returns $30^\circ$.
* **Caution:** The calculator only provides one value. Because functions are periodic, other angles (like $150^\circ$) may share the same value.

#### 5. Summary Table
| Goal | Calculator Input Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Find Sine, Cosine, Tangent** | Use direct buttons (`SIN`, `COS`, `TAN`) |
| **Find Reciprocal Functions** | Use `1 / (Primary Function)` |
| **Find an Angle** | Use Inverse buttons (`SIN⁻¹`, etc.) |
| **Verify Mode** | Check screen for **DEG** or **RAD** |
### Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions to Find Angles

Inverse trigonometric functions are used to "undo" a trigonometric function to find the measure of an unknown angle $\theta$. 

#### 1. Notation: $cos^{-1}$ vs. $arccos$
Both notations refer to the same mathematical operation.
* **$cos^{-1}(x)$**: This is the notation typically used on scientific calculators. It does *not* mean $1/\cos(x)$; it represents the "inverse cosine."
* **$\arccos(x)$**: This is the standard written notation. 
* **The Goal**: If $\cos \theta = x$, then $\theta = \arccos(x)$.

#### 2. The Role of Restrictions
Trigonometric functions are periodic (they repeat forever). This means there are infinite angles that could result in the same cosine value. To get a single, useful answer, we use **Restrictions**.

**Common Restriction: $0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$**
* This tells you the angle must be **acute** (in Quadrant I).
* This is common in geometry and right-triangle problems where negative angles or angles larger than a triangle can hold don't make sense.

#### 3. Using a Calculator with Restrictions
When you use a calculator to find an angle, it follows built-in "Principal Value" ranges.

**For $\cos^{-1}(x)$:**
* The calculator is programmed to only give answers between **$0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$**.
* If your restriction is **$0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$**, you simply use the calculator value directly as long as the input $x$ is positive.

**Step-by-Step Calculator Process:**
1. **Check Mode:** Ensure the calculator is in **DEGREE** mode.
2. **Input:** Press `2nd` or `Shift`, then the `COS` button (this activates $cos^{-1}$).
3. **Value:** Enter the decimal or fraction value.
4. **Solve:** Press `ENTER` or =.

**Example:**
Find $\theta$ if $\cos \theta = 0.866$ and $0^\circ \le \theta \le 90^\circ$.
* Input: `cos⁻¹(0.866)`
* Output: $\approx 30^\circ$
* This fits your restriction, so $\theta = 30^\circ$.

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function | Notation | Calculator Buttons | Range of Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inverse Sine** | $\arcsin(x)$ or $\sin^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `SIN` | $-90^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ |
| **Inverse Cosine** | $\arccos(x)$ or $\cos^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `COS` | $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ |
| **Inverse Tangent** | $\arctan(x)$ or $\tan^{-1}(x)$ | `2nd` + `TAN` | $-90^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ |

#### 5. Important Note on Secant/Cosecant/Cotangent
Calculators do not have `sec⁻¹` buttons. To find $\theta$ for $\sec \theta = 2$:
1. Convert to cosine: $\cos \theta = 1/2$.
2. Use the calculator: $\theta = \cos^{-1}(0.5)$.
3. $\theta = 60^\circ$.
## 2026-January-09 - Solving Right Triangles | Angles of Elevation / Depression : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h39m15s
### Solving Right Triangles: Angles of Elevation and Depression

When we "solve" a right triangle, we are finding the lengths of all three sides and the measures of all three angles. Angles of Elevation and Depression are specific types of angles used to solve real-world distance and height problems.

#### 1. Solving a Right Triangle
To solve a right triangle, you generally need to know:
* One side and one acute angle, **OR**
* Two sides.
Once you have these, you use $SOH CAH TOA$ to find the missing pieces.

#### 2. Angle of Elevation
The **Angle of Elevation** is the angle formed by a horizontal line of sight and the line of sight **up** to an object.
* **Point of View**: Looking from the ground up to the top of a building or a bird in a tree.
* **Placement**: It is always inside the triangle at the base, looking up.

#### 3. Angle of Depression
The **Angle of Depression** is the angle formed by a horizontal line of sight and the line of sight **down** to an object.
* **Point of View**: Looking from the top of a cliff down to a boat or from a plane down to a runway.
* **Critical Rule**: The angle of depression is located **outside** the vertical triangle (between the horizontal line and the hypotenuse).

#### 4. The Geometry Shortcut (Parallel Lines)
Because the horizontal line for the "viewer" at the top and the horizontal ground at the bottom are **parallel**, the Angle of Depression is equal to the Angle of Elevation from the object back up to the viewer.
* **Rule**: $\text{Angle of Depression} = \text{Angle of Elevation}$ (due to alternate interior angles).

#### 5. Step-by-Step Problem Solving
1. **Draw a Diagram**: Start with a horizontal line.
2. **Identify the Angle**: Label the angle of elevation or depression.
3. **Label Sides**: Identify which side is the Opposite, Adjacent, or Hypotenuse relative to your angle.
4. **Choose a Function**:
    * Use **Tangent** if you have/need the height and the horizontal distance (Opposite and Adjacent).
    * Use **Sine** or **Cosine** if the hypotenuse (slant distance) is involved.
5. **Solve**: Use your calculator (ensure it's in **DEGREE** mode).

#### 6. Summary Table
| Term                    | Direction of Sight | Angle Location                                 |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Angle of Elevation**  | Upward             | Between horizontal ground and line of sight    |
| **Angle of Depression** | Downward           | Between horizontal eye-level and line of sight |
| **Key Identity**        | Equal              | Both are equal if viewing the same two points  |
### Solving the Right Triangle 

#### 1. Analysis of Given Information
We will use standard notation where $C$ is the right angle and $c$ is the hypotenuse.

* **Angle $C$**: $90^\circ$ (Right angle)
* **Angle $A$**: $37^\circ$ (Given acute angle)
* **Side $c$**: $14$ (Hypotenuse)

#### 2. Solving for the Missing Angle ($B$)
Since the two acute angles in a right triangle must add up to $90^\circ$:
* $B = 90^\circ - 37^\circ$
* **$B = 53^\circ$**

#### 3. Solving for Side $a$ (Opposite to $37^\circ$)
To find the side opposite Angle $A$, we use the **Sine** function ($\sin = \text{Opposite} / \text{Hypotenuse}$):
* $\sin(37^\circ) = \frac{a}{14}$
* $a = 14 \times \sin(37^\circ)$
* $a \approx 14 \times 0.6018$
* **$a \approx 8.43$**

#### 4. Solving for Side $b$ (Adjacent to $37^\circ$)
To find the base side, we use the **Cosine** function ($\cos = \text{Adjacent} / \text{Hypotenuse}$):
* $\cos(37^\circ) = \frac{b}{14}$
* $b = 14 \times \cos(37^\circ)$
* $b \approx 14 \times 0.7986$
* **$b \approx 11.18$**

#### Summary Table
| Part | Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Angle A** | $37^\circ$ | Given |
| **Angle B** | $53^\circ$ | Calculated |
| **Angle C** | $90^\circ$ | Given |
| **Side a (Opposite A)** | $\approx 8.43$ | Calculated |
| **Side b (Adjacent A)** | $\approx 11.18$ | Calculated |
| **Side c (Hypotenuse)** | $14$ | Given |
### Solving the Right Triangle (Hypotenuse and One Leg Given)

To solve this triangle, we use the **Pythagorean Theorem** to find the missing side and **Inverse Trigonometric Functions** to find the missing angles.

#### 1. Analysis of Given Information
In standard right triangle notation (where $C$ is the $90^\circ$ angle):
* **Side $b$ (Adjacent to $A$):** $4$
* **Side $c$ (Hypotenuse):** $15.4$
* **Side $a$ (Opposite to $A$):** Unknown
* **Angle $C$:** $90^\circ$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Solve for Side $a$ (The missing leg)**
We use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
* $a^2 + 4^2 = 15.4^2$
* $a^2 + 16 = 237.16$
* $a^2 = 237.16 - 16$
* $a^2 = 221.16$
* $a = \sqrt{221.16} \approx \mathbf{14.87}$

**Step 2: Solve for Angle $A$**
Since we know the **Adjacent** side ($4$) and the **Hypotenuse** ($15.4$), we use the inverse cosine function ($\arccos$ or $\cos^{-1}$):
* $\cos(A) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{15.4}$
* $A = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{15.4}\right)$
* $A \approx \cos^{-1}(0.2597)$
* **$A \approx 74.95^\circ$**

**Step 3: Solve for Angle $B$**
The two acute angles must sum to $90^\circ$:
* $B = 90^\circ - 74.95^\circ$
* **$B \approx 15.05^\circ$**

### Word Problem: Flagpole Height Calculation

**Problem:**
When Max is **123 feet** away from the base of the school's flagpole, the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is **26° 40'**. Find the height of the flagpole if his eyes are **5.30 feet** above the ground.

---

### 1. Analysis of Given Information
* **Distance (Adjacent side, $b$):** $123$ feet.
* **Angle of Elevation ($\theta$):** $26^\circ 40'$.
* **Eye Level Height ($h_{eye}$):** $5.30$ feet.
* **Goal:** Find the total height of the flagpole ($H$).


---

### 2. Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Convert Angle to Decimal Degrees
Trigonometric functions in code and most calculators work best with decimal degrees. Since there are 60 minutes in a degree:
* $40' = \frac{40}{60} = 0.666...^\circ$
* $\theta = 26.667^\circ$

#### Step 2: Solve for the height above eye level ($a$)
We use the **Tangent** function because we have the **Adjacent** side ($123$) and want to find the **Opposite** side ($a$).
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$$
* $\tan(26.667^\circ) = \frac{a}{123}$
* $a = 123 \times \tan(26.667^\circ)$
* $a \approx 123 \times 0.5022$
* $a \approx \mathbf{61.77 \text{ feet}}$

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Height ($H$)
To get the total height of the flagpole, we must add Max's eye level height to the calculated side $a$.
* $H = a + h_{eye}$
* $H = 61.77 + 5.30$
* **$H \approx 67.07 \text{ feet}$**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=2h51m35s
### Converting Between Radians and Degrees

Trigonometry uses two primary units to measure rotation: **Degrees** (based on a $360^\circ$ circle) and **Radians** (based on the radius of the circle).

#### 1. The Core Relationship
The conversion is based on the fact that a half-circle ($180^\circ$) is equal to $\pi$ radians.
* **Full Circle:** $360^\circ = 2\pi$ radians
* **Half Circle:** $180^\circ = \pi$ radians

---

#### 2. Conversion Formulas

To convert from one unit to the other, multiply by the appropriate conversion factor:

**Degrees to Radians**
Multiply the degrees by $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$:
$$\text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$

**Radians to Degrees**
Multiply the radians by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$:
$$\text{Degrees} = \text{Radians} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$$

---

#### 3. Common Reference Values
| Degrees         | Radians (Exact) | Radians (Approx) |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- |
| **$30^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $0.524$          |
| **$45^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{4}$ | $0.785$          |
| **$60^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $1.047$          |
| **$90^\circ$**  | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | $1.571$          |
| **$180^\circ$** | $\pi$           | $3.142$          |
| **$360^\circ$** | $2\pi$          | $6.283$          |


---

#### 4. Memory Trick
* If you want to get **Radians**, you want $\pi$ in the "numerator" (top).
* If you want to get **Degrees**, you want $\pi$ in the "denominator" (bottom) so it cancels out.
### Conversion: 150 Degrees to Radians

To convert degrees to radians, we multiply by the conversion factor $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$. This works because $\pi$ radians and $180^\circ$ represent the same amount of rotation (a half-circle).

#### 1. The Calculation
$$\text{Radians} = 150^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$



#### 2. Simplifying the Fraction
1.  **Set up the fraction:** $\frac{150\pi}{180}$
2.  **Divide by the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Both 150 and 180 are divisible by 30.
    * $150 \div 30 = 5$
    * $180 \div 30 = 6$



#### 3. Final Results
* **Exact Form:** $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ radians
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 2.618$ radians
### Conversion: 260 Degrees to Radians

To convert degrees to radians, we use the conversion factor $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$. This formula cancels out the degree units and introduces radians.

#### 1. The Setup
$$\text{Radians} = 260^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$$

#### 2. Simplifying the Fraction
1.  **Write as a single fraction:** $\frac{260\pi}{180}$
2.  **Simplify by dividing by the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
    * Both 260 and 180 are divisible by 20.
    * $260 \div 20 = 13$
    * $180 \div 20 = 9$

#### 3. Final Result
* **Exact Form:** $\frac{13\pi}{9}$ radians
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 4.538$ radians
### Conversion: -157π/36 Radians to Degrees

To convert from radians to degrees, we multiply the value by the conversion factor $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. This allows the $\pi$ terms to cancel out, leaving the final measurement in degrees.

#### 1. The Mathematical Setup
$$\text{Degrees} = \left( -\frac{157\pi}{36} \right) \times \left( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \right)$$

---

#### 2. Step-by-Step Simplification

**Step A: Cancel the $\pi$ terms**
Since $\pi$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, they cancel out:
$$-\frac{157}{36} \times 180^\circ$$

**Step B: Simplify the numbers**
Instead of multiplying $157 \times 180$ first, it is more efficient to divide $180$ by $36$:
1.  Check if 36 goes into 180: $180 \div 36 = 5$.
2.  Rewrite the expression: $-157 \times 5^\circ$.



**Step C: Final Multiplication**
$$-157 \times 5 = -785$$

---

#### 3. Final Result
* **Degrees:** $-785^\circ$
### Conversion: -43π/12 Radians to Degrees

To convert radians to degrees, we multiply by the conversion factor $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$. This setup ensures that the $\pi$ units cancel out, leaving the value in degrees.

#### 1. The Mathematical Setup
$$\text{Degrees} = \left( -\frac{43\pi}{12} \right) \times \left( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \right)$$

#### 2. Step-by-Step Simplification

**Step A: Cancel the $\pi$ terms**
The $\pi$ in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out:
$$-\frac{43}{12} \times 180^\circ$$

**Step B: Simplify the division**
It is much easier to divide $180$ by $12$ before multiplying by $43$:
1.  $180 \div 12 = 15$
2.  Now the expression is: $-43 \times 15^\circ$



**Step C: Final Multiplication**
$$-43 \times 15 = -645$$

#### 3. Final Result
* **Degrees:** $-645^\circ$

## 2026-January-10 - Arc Length on a Circle - Area of a Sector of a Circle :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h3m30s
### Arc Length on a Circle

The **Arc Length** ($s$) is the distance along the curved line that makes up a section of a circle's circumference. Think of it as the "crust" of a pizza slice.

#### 1. The Core Formulas
The formula you use depends on whether your central angle ($\theta$) is in **Radians** or **Degrees**.

**If $\theta$ is in Radians (The Direct Method):**
Since a radian is defined by the ratio of the arc length to the radius, the formula is elegant and simple:
$$s = r\theta$$
*(Where $s$ = arc length, $r$ = radius, and $\theta$ = central angle in radians)*

**If $\theta$ is in Degrees (The Proportional Method):**
You take a fraction of the total circumference ($2\pi r$):
$$s = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r$$



---

#### 2. Visual Relationship
* If $\theta = 2\pi$ (a full circle), then $s = 2\pi r$ (the full circumference).
* If $\theta = \pi$ (a half circle), then $s = \pi r$.
* If $\theta = 1$ radian, then $s = r$ (the arc length is exactly equal to the radius).

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation (Example)
**Problem:** Find the arc length if the radius is **6 cm** and the central angle is **$120^\circ$**.

1.  **Convert to Radians (Recommended):**
    $$120^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{ radians}$$
2.  **Apply the formula ($s = r\theta$):**
    $$s = 6 \times \frac{2\pi}{3}$$
3.  **Simplify:**
    $$s = 4\pi \approx 12.57 \text{ cm}$$
### Area of a Sector of a Circle

A **sector** of a circle is the portion of the disk enclosed by two radii and an arc. You can think of it as a "slice" of a pizza or pie.

---
#### Geometric Definition
The area of a sector depends on the **radius ($r$)** of the circle and the **central angle ($\theta$)** subtended by the arc at the center.

---
#### Formula 1: Using Radians
When the angle $\theta$ is measured in **radians**, the formula is derived from the proportion of the sector's area to the total area of the circle ($A = \pi r^2$):

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta$$

* **$r$**: Radius of the circle
* **$\theta$**: Central angle in radians

---
#### Formula 2: Using Degrees
If the angle $\theta$ is measured in **degrees**, the formula is adjusted to represent the fraction of the $360^\circ$ circle:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$$

---
#### Relationship to Arc Length
Since the arc length $s$ is defined as $s = r\theta$, you can also express the area in terms of the arc length:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} rs$$

---
#### Example Calculation
**Problem:** Find the area of a sector with a radius of $6\text{ cm}$ and a central angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians.

1.  **Identify variables:** $r = 6$, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.
2.  **Apply formula:** $A = \frac{1}{2}(6)^2(\frac{\pi}{3})$.
3.  **Simplify:** $A = \frac{1}{2}(36)(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 18(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 6\pi\text{ cm}^2$.
## 2026-January-10 - Unit Circle and Circular Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h16m45s
### Unit Circle and Circular Functions

The **Unit Circle** is a circle with a radius of 1 ($r = 1$) centered at the origin $(0, 0)$ in the Cartesian plane. It is the fundamental tool for defining trigonometric functions for all real numbers, moving beyond simple right-triangle geometry.

---
#### 1. The Unit Circle Equation
The algebraic representation of the unit circle is:
$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$

Any point $P(x, y)$ on the circumference of this circle corresponds to a central angle $\theta$ (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis).

---
#### 2. Defining Circular Functions
In a unit circle, because the hypotenuse is always 1, the trigonometric ratios simplify directly to the coordinates of the point $P(x, y)$:

* **Cosine**: $\cos(\theta) = x$
* **Sine**: $\sin(\theta) = y$
* **Tangent**: $\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ (where $x \neq 0$)

These are called **circular functions** because their values are determined by the position of a point moving around a circle.

---

#### 3. Reciprocal and Related Functions
From these primary definitions, we derive the remaining circular functions:
* **Secant**: $\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}$
* **Cosecant**: $\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{y}$
* **Cotangent**: $\cot(\theta) = \frac{x}{y}$

---

#### 4. The Pythagorean Identity
Since every point $(x, y)$ on the circle satisfies $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, substituting our circular functions gives the fundamental identity:
$$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$$

---

#### 5. Signs by Quadrant (ASTC)
The signs of the circular functions depend on the quadrant where the terminal side of the angle $\theta$ lies:
| Quadrant | Coordinates | Positive Functions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** ($0$ to $\pi/2$) | $(+, +)$ | **A**ll (Sin, Cos, Tan) |
| **II** ($\pi/2$ to $\pi$) | $(-, +)$ | **S**ine (and Csc) |
| **III** ($\pi$ to $3\pi/2$) | $(-, -)$ | **T**angent (and Cot) |
| **IV** ($3\pi/2$ to $2\pi$) | $(+, -)$ | **C**osine (and Sec) |

### Arc Length on the Unit Circle

On a **Unit Circle**, the radius is exactly $1$ ($r = 1$). This unique property creates a direct numerical link between the central angle and the distance traveled along the edge of the circle.

---

#### 1. The Arc Length Formula
The general formula for arc length $s$ is:
$$s = r\theta$$

Where:
* $s$ is the arc length.
* $r$ is the radius.
* $\theta$ is the central angle in **radians**.

---

#### 2. The $s = \theta$ Relationship
Because $r = 1$ on the unit circle, the formula simplifies to:
$$s = (1)\theta \implies s = \theta$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On a unit circle, the **arc length is numerically equal to the central angle** (when measured in radians). For example, if the central angle is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the distance along the curve is also exactly $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units.



---

#### 3. Comparison: Degrees vs. Radians
| Measurement | Formula for Unit Circle ($r=1$) | Example ($90^\circ$ or $\pi/2$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Radians** | $s = \theta$ | $s = \pi/2 \approx 1.57$ |
| **Degrees** | $s = \frac{\pi \theta}{180}$ | $s = \frac{90\pi}{180} = \pi/2$ |

---

#### 4. Why This Matters
This relationship is the reason why **radians** are the preferred unit in calculus and physics. It treats the angle as a physical distance along the circle's path, making circular motion and wave functions much easier to calculate.
### Special Angles and Reference Triangles on the Unit Circle

The coordinates $(x, y)$ for special angles on the unit circle are derived from two specific right triangles where the hypotenuse is $1$.

---

#### 1. The $45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ$ Triangle ($\pi/4$)
When the central angle is $45^\circ$ (or $\pi/4$ radians), the triangle is isosceles.
* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$
* **Trig Values:** $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$


---

#### 2. The $30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ$ Triangle ($\pi/6$ and $\pi/3$)
This triangle provides the coordinates for both $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ by swapping the long and short legs.

* **At $30^\circ$ ($\pi/6$):** The horizontal leg ($x$) is longer.
	* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$
* **At $60^\circ$ ($\pi/3$):** The vertical leg ($y$) is longer.
	* **Coordinates:** $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$


---

#### 3. Summary Table (Quadrant I)
| Angle (Deg) | Angle (Rad) | $x$ ($\cos \theta$) | $y$ ($\sin \theta$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0^\circ$ | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |
| $30^\circ$ | $\pi/6$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $45^\circ$ | $\pi/4$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $\pi/3$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | $\pi/2$ | $0$ | $1$ |

---

#### 4. Quadrantal Angles
These are angles where the terminal side lies on an axis. They do not form triangles but represent the "boundaries" of the circle:
* **Positive x-axis ($0$):** $(1, 0)$
* **Positive y-axis ($\pi/2$):** $(0, 1)$
* **Negative x-axis ($\pi$):** $(-1, 0)$
* **Negative y-axis ($3\pi/2$):** $(0, -1)$

### Summary of Unit Circle Memory Tricks

The coordinates for special angles in the first quadrant follow a predictable mathematical pattern. By using these counting methods, you can derive the entire unit circle without rote memorization.

---

#### 1. The Square Root Counting Trick
Every coordinate in the first quadrant has a denominator of **2**. You simply count from 0 to 4 inside a square root for the numerators.

| Angle ($\theta$) | $x$-coordinate ($\frac{\sqrt{\text{count}}}{2}$) | $y$-coordinate ($\frac{\sqrt{\text{count}}}{2}$) | Resulting $(x, y)$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$0^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} = 1$ | $\frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} = 0$ | $(1, 0)$ |
| **$30^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ | $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ |
| **$45^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ | $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ |
| **$60^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ | $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ |
| **$90^\circ$** | $\frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} = 0$ | $\frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} = 1$ | $(0, 1)$ |

* **To find Cosine ($x$):** Count **down** from 4 to 0.
* **To find Sine ($y$):** Count **up** from 0 to 4.

---

#### 2. The Left-Hand Rule
A physical way to remember the coordinates:
1.  **Assign Fingers:** Thumb ($90^\circ$), Index ($60^\circ$), Middle ($45^\circ$), Ring ($30^\circ$), Pinky ($0^\circ$).
2.  **Fold a Finger:** To find values for an angle, fold that specific finger.
3.  **Calculate:**
    * **$\cos \theta$:** $\frac{\sqrt{\text{fingers above}}}{2}$
    * **$\sin \theta$:** $\frac{\sqrt{\text{fingers below}}}{2}$

---

#### 3. Tangent Values Trick
Since $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$, you can use the "Fingers Below over Fingers Above" trick:
$$\tan \theta = \sqrt{\frac{\text{fingers below}}{\text{fingers above}}}$$

* **$\tan(30^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{1/3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$
* **$\tan(45^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{2/2} = 1$
* **$\tan(60^\circ)$:** $\sqrt{3/1} = \sqrt{3}$

---

#### 4. ASTC: Quadrant Signs
To remember which functions are **positive** in each quadrant, use the mnemonic:
**A**ll **S**tudents **T**ake **C**alculus

* **Q1 (A):** **A**ll functions are positive.
* **Q2 (S):** **S**ine (and Csc) are positive.
* **Q3 (T):** **T**angent (and Cot) are positive.
* **Q4 (C):** **C**osine (and Sec) are positive.

### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = \frac{3\pi}{4}$

To solve for the trigonometric values of $\frac{3\pi}{4}$, we locate the angle on the unit circle and use its reference angle and quadrant.

---

#### 1. Locate the Angle
* **Position:** $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant II** (between $\pi/2$ and $\pi$).
* **Reference Angle ($\theta'$):** The distance to the x-axis is $\pi - \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ (or $45^\circ$).



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
In Quadrant II, the $x$-coordinate is negative and the $y$-coordinate is positive. Using the values for a $45^\circ$ reference angle:
* **$x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\cos \theta = x$, and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$:

* **$\sin \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\sin \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
* **$\cos \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\cos \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
* **$\tan \frac{3\pi}{4}$**: 
	$$\tan \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1$$

---

#### 4. Verification (ASTC)
In Quadrant II, only **Sine** (and Cosecant) should be positive.
* Sine is positive ($\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$) ✅
* Cosine is negative ($-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$) ✅
* Tangent is negative ($-1$) ✅
### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = \frac{13\pi}{6}$

To solve for the trigonometric values of $\frac{13\pi}{6}$, we first need to find its **coterminal angle** within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range.

---

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
Since $\frac{13\pi}{6}$ is greater than $2\pi$ ($\frac{12\pi}{6}$), we subtract one full rotation:
$$\frac{13\pi}{6} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{6} - \frac{12\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

* **Position:** $\frac{\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\circ$) is in **Quadrant I**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\frac{\pi}{6}$.



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
Using the special angle values for $\frac{\pi}{6}$ in Quadrant I, both $x$ and $y$ are positive:
* **$x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{1}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{x}$, and $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{y}$:

### Solving Trig Functions for $\theta = -\frac{23\pi}{4}$

To solve for an angle like $-\frac{23\pi}{4}$, we first find a **coterminal angle** within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range to identify its position on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. Find the Coterminal Angle
We add multiples of $2\pi$ (which is $\frac{8\pi}{4}$) until we get a positive value between $0$ and $2\pi$:

$$-\frac{23\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = -\frac{15\pi}{4}$$
$$-\frac{15\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = -\frac{7\pi}{4}$$
$$-\frac{7\pi}{4} + \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

* **Position:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$ (or $45^\circ$) is in **Quadrant I**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$.



---

#### 2. Identify the Coordinates $(x, y)$
Using the special angle values for $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in Quadrant I:
* **$x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**
* **$y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$**

Point $P$ on the unit circle is: $\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$

---

#### 3. Calculate Circular Functions
Using the definitions $\sin \theta = y$, $\cos \theta = x$, and $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$:

* **$\sin \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\sin \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cos \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\cos \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cot \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right)$**:
    $$\cot \left(-\frac{23\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1$$

---

#### 4. Verification (ASTC)
Since the coterminal angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant I**, **A**ll functions should be positive.
* Sine is positive ✅
* Cosine is positive ✅
* Cotangent is positive ✅

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h33m25s
### Linear and Angular Speed

When an object moves along a circular path, we can describe its motion in two ways: how fast it travels along the edge (**linear speed**) and how fast the central angle changes (**angular speed**).

---

#### 1. Angular Speed ($\omega$)
Angular speed measures the rate at which the central angle $\theta$ changes over time. It is represented by the Greek letter omega ($\omega$).

**Formula:**
$$\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$$

* **$\omega$**: Angular speed (usually in radians per unit of time).
* **$\theta$**: Central angle in **radians**.
* **$t$**: Time.

> [!CAUTION]
> If the problem gives you rotations or degrees, you **must** convert to radians first. ($1$ rotation $= 2\pi$ radians).

---

#### 2. Linear Speed ($v$)
Linear speed measures the distance traveled along the arc ($s$) per unit of time. It is the "speedometer" speed of an object moving in a circle.

**Formula:**
$$v = \frac{s}{t}$$

Since arc length $s = r\theta$, we can also write:
$$v = \frac{r\theta}{t}$$



---

#### 3. Relationship Between Linear and Angular Speed
The most useful way to connect these two concepts is through the radius ($r$). Since $v = \frac{r\theta}{t}$ and $\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$, we can substitute:

$$v = r\omega$$

* **Linear speed ($v$)** is the product of the **radius ($r$)** and the **angular speed ($\omega$)**.

---

#### 4. Example Calculation
**Problem:** A wheel with a radius of $10$ inches is spinning at $3$ revolutions per second. Find its linear speed.

1.  **Find Angular Speed ($\omega$):**
    $3 \text{ rev/sec} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 6\pi \text{ rad/sec}$.
2.  **Calculate Linear Speed ($v$):**
    $v = r\omega$
    $v = 10 \text{ in} \times 6\pi \text{ rad/sec} = 60\pi \text{ in/sec}$.
3.  **Decimal Approximation:**
    $\approx 188.5 \text{ in/sec}$.

---

#### 5. Comparison Table
| Feature      | Angular Speed ($\omega$) | Linear Speed ($v$) |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Measures** | Change in angle          | Change in distance |
| **Units**    | rad/sec, rpm             | m/s, mph, in/sec   |
| **Formula**  | $\omega = \theta / t$    | $v = s / t$        |
| **Relation** | $\omega = v / r$         | $v = r\omega$      |
### Word Problem: Linear Speed of a Cart on a Circular Track

**Problem:**
At a local high school, Max rides his cart around a circular track at $2$ revolutions per minute. If the radius of the circular track is $150$ meters, how fast is Max's cart traveling in meters per second?

---

#### 1. Given Information
* **Radius ($r$):** $150 \text{ m}$
* **Angular Speed ($\omega$):** $2 \text{ rev/min}$
* **Target Units:** Meters per second ($\text{m/s}$)

---

#### 2. Conversion Constants
* $1 \text{ revolution} = 2\pi \text{ radians}$
* $1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}$

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Solution

**Step 1: Convert Angular Speed to radians per second**
First, convert revolutions per minute to radians per minute:
$$\omega = 2 \text{ rev/min} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 4\pi \text{ rad/min}$$

Now, convert radians per minute to radians per second:
$$\omega = \frac{4\pi \text{ rad}}{60 \text{ sec}} = \frac{\pi}{15} \text{ rad/sec}$$

**Step 2: Calculate Linear Speed ($v$)**
Using the relationship formula $v = r\omega$:
$$v = 150 \text{ m} \times \frac{\pi}{15} \text{ rad/sec}$$



**Step 3: Simplify**
$$v = \frac{150\pi}{15} = 10\pi \text{ m/s}$$

---

#### 4. Final Result
* **Exact Value:** $10\pi \text{ m/s}$
* **Decimal Approximation:** $\approx 31.42 \text{ m/s}$

> [!SUCCESS] Answer
> Max's cart is traveling at exactly **$10\pi$ meters per second**, which is approximately **$31.42 \text{ m/s}$**.

## 2026-January-11 - Graphing Sine and Cosine :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=3h47m20s
### Periodic Functions: $f(x) = f(x + np)$

A **periodic function** is a function that repeats its values at regular intervals or "periods." This is a core property of trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

---

#### 1. Mathematical Definition
A function $f$ is periodic if there exists a non-zero constant $p$ such that:
$$f(x) = f(x + p)$$
for all values of $x$ in the domain. The smallest positive value of $p$ is called the **fundamental period** (or simply the **period**).

---

#### 2. The Multi-Period Property: $f(x) = f(x + np)$
If a function repeats every $p$ units, it also repeats every $2p$, $3p$, or any integer multiple of $p$.
$$f(x) = f(x + np)$$
* **$n$**: Any integer ($\dots, -2, -1, 1, 2, \dots$).
* **$p$**: The period of the function.

> [!NOTE]
> This means that if you know the behavior of the function over one period (the interval $[0, p]$), you know its behavior for all real numbers.



---

#### 3. Examples in Trigonometry
The standard trigonometric functions are the most common examples of periodic behavior:

| Function | Period ($p$) | Property |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin(x)$** | $2\pi$ | $\sin(x) = \sin(x + 2n\pi)$ |
| **$\cos(x)$** | $2\pi$ | $\cos(x) = \cos(x + 2n\pi)$ |
| **$\tan(x)$** | $\pi$ | $\tan(x) = \tan(x + n\pi)$ |

---

#### 4. Visualizing the Concept
Think of a periodic function like a **stamp**. One period is the design on the stamp; the function itself is what happens when you press that stamp repeatedly across a piece of paper.

* **Cycles:** One complete execution of the pattern is called a cycle.
* **Frequency:** The number of cycles that occur per unit of horizontal distance ($1/p$).

---

#### 5. Application: Solving for Large Angles
Because of the $f(x) = f(x + np)$ property, you can simplify large angles by subtracting multiples of the period:
**Example:** Find $\sin( \frac{13\pi}{4} )$.
1.  Subtract $2\pi$ (one period): $\frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$.
2.  $\sin( \frac{13\pi}{4} ) = \sin( \frac{5\pi}{4} ) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
### Graphing Sine and Cosine Functions

This section of the course focuses on the visual representation of the periodic functions $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$. It introduces the standard form used for transformations:

$$y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k$$

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs
* **Sine ($y = \sin x$):** Starts at the origin $(0,0)$, goes up to its maximum, down through the x-axis, to its minimum, and back to the start.
* **Cosine ($y = \cos x$):** Starts at its maximum $(0, a)$, goes down through the x-axis to its minimum, and back up to the maximum.

![[Pasted image 20260111145830.png]]
- **x intercepts** are on the $n*\pi$ : $\pi$  and $2\pi$
- **Maximum** Occurs at 1/4 of the way through : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 
- **Minimum** Occurs at 3/4 of the way through : $\frac{3\pi}{2}$
![[Pasted image 20260111165817.png]]
- $f(x) = cos x$ : Cos graphs are just phaseshifted $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units left, exactly the same as sin graphs, just different start
- **X Intercepts** : $(2n + 1)\frac{\pi}{2}$ : x intercepts are found at 2n + 1 times pi over 2
- 
---

#### 2. Key Vocabulary & Transformations
* **Amplitude ($|a|$):** Half the distance between the maximum and minimum values. It describes the "height" of the wave.
    * If $a < 0$, the graph is **reflected** over the x-axis.
* **Period ($P$):** The horizontal length of one complete cycle. 
    * Formula: $P = \frac{2\pi}{b}$
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** The horizontal shift (left or right).
    * $x - h$ shifts **right**.
    * $x + h$ shifts **left**.
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** The vertical shift (up or down). This also determines the **midline** of the graph.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Graphing Process
1.  **Identify the Midline ($k$):** Draw a dashed horizontal line at $y = k$.
2.  **Determine Amplitude:** Mark the max and min boundaries ($k + a$ and $k - a$).
3.  **Calculate the Period:** Find the end of one cycle using $2\pi/b$.
4.  **Divide into "Key Points":** Divide the period into four equal intervals. This gives you the five critical points:
    * *Start, Quarter-way, Midpoint, Three-quarters, End.*
5.  **Apply Phase Shift:** Slide those five points left or right based on $h$.
6.  **Sketch the Curve:** Connect the points with a smooth, continuous wave.

---

$$y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k$$

- **f(x) = -2 sin x**  : 2 things going on in this image, 1) *2* a vertical stretch that doubles it's size, and 2) a '*-*' negative which flips it on the x axis 
![[Pasted image 20260111161856.png]]
- **$f(x) = 3sin \frac{1}{3}x$** : 2 things going on in this one : 1) '*3*' vertical stretch 2) $\frac{x}{3}$ or $\frac{1}{3}x$ horizontal stretch of 3 (notice how one cycle ends at $6\pi$ instead of $2\pi$ - a 1/3 stretch is inverted and actually increase it by 3)
![[Pasted image 20260111163321.png]]
- $f(x) = 4 sin (2x -2\pi / 3)$ : (factor out the '2') $f(x) = 4 sin [2(x -\pi / 3)]$ : Phase/Horizontal Shift : $(x -\pi / 3)$ this *counterintuitively* shifts it to the right by 3, and it starts at $\frac{\pi}{3}$  instead of '0', 
- the other transformations are '4' vertical stretch by factor of 4, and '2x' = horizontal compressed by factor of 1/2 (runs through a cycle in half the time)
![[Pasted image 20260111164523.png]]
- $f(x) = 4 sin (3x + 3\pi / 4) -1$ : (factor out the '3') $f(x) = 4 sin [3(x + \frac{\pi}{4})]-1$ Vertical Shift '-1' at the end, drops it down one on the y axis
- Other transformations are : '4' sin increases the vertical stretch by a factor of 4, horizontal compression of 1/3, phase shift left by $\pi / 4$

## 2026-January-12 Graphing a Tangent and Cotangent :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=4h54m45s
- $tan x = tan(x + \pi n)$ 
- $cot x = cot(x + \pi n)$ 
- When working with *sine and cosine* the period is $2\pi$, when working with *tan and cot* the period is $\pi$ 
- **Period** : How often it repeats
- $tan x = \frac{sin x}{cos x}$ :You can find the *tangent* on a *unit circle* by dividing the *sine* by the *cosine*
- $tan \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{sin\frac{\pi}{6}}{cos\frac{\pi}{6}}$ : $\frac{1}{2}$ * $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$  to find the tangent of pi over 6(30$\degree$), divide the $sin\frac{\pi}{6}$ by $cos\frac{\pi}{6}$ on a unit circle
- $\frac{\pi}{2}$ + $\pi n$ : Whenever the $cos$ value is '0' the value of tangent is **undefined**, this includes $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ as well as their coterminal angles - The tangent is undefined at *odd multiples* of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 
- When *sin* is 0 and *cos* is not 0, tan will be '0'
- The closer you get to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the closer you get to $\infty$, **increase without bound** but will never touch $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which is *undefined*
- **Consecutive Vertical Asymptotes** : When you have repeating vertical asymptotes (approaches infinitely, but doesn't touch)
- **Quarter Period** : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ * $\frac{1}{4}$ 
-  $cot x = \frac{cos x}{sin x}$ :You can find the *cotangent* on a *unit circle* by dividing the *cosine* by the *sine* - Since sine and cosine are switched, anywhere that sine is '0' cot will be 'undefined' and anywhere that cos is '0' cot will be '0'
- cot $\pi n$ will be where the undefined sections are
### Graphing Tangent and Cotangent Functions

Tangent and cotangent functions are unique because they are defined as ratios that include variables in the denominator ($\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$ and $\cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$). This results in **vertical asymptotes** where the denominator is zero.

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs
* **Tangent ($y = \tan x$):**
    * **Period:** $\pi$ (repeats twice as often as sine/cosine).
    * **Asymptotes:** Occur at $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$ (where $\cos x = 0$).
    * **Shape:** An increasing "S-curve" that passes through the origin $(0,0)$.
![[Pasted image 20260112162129.png]]
- **Memorize these three points** When graphing a tangent, the main points you want to find are $(\frac{-\pi}{4}, -1)$, $(0,0)$, $(\frac{\pi}{4}, 1)$ to get the main shape of the tangent - To find the next point of a similiar type, add $\frac{\pi}{8}$ 
- *X Intercepts* are of the form $x=\pi n$ where 'n' is any integer - The x intercept occurs at *1/2* of the way between the consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '0'
- *1\4* of the way between consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '-1'
- *3\4* of the way between consecutive vertical asymptotes has a y-coordinate of '-1'
- There are no minimum or maximum values
- The range is *infinite*
- The graph has *no amplitude*
- The graph is symetric with respect to the origin

* **Cotangent ($y = \cot x$):**
    * **Period:** $\pi$.
    * **Asymptotes:** Occur at $x = n\pi$ (where $\sin x = 0$).
    * **Shape:** A decreasing curve that is a horizontal shift and reflection of the tangent graph.
![[Pasted image 20260112175704.png]]
- **Memorize these three points** When graphing a tangent, the main points you want to find are the quarter point, mid point and three quarter point : $(\frac{\pi}{4}, 1)$ , $(\frac{\pi}{2},0)$,  $(\frac{3 \pi}{4}, -1)$ to get the main shape of the tangent - To find the next point of a similiar type, add $\frac{\pi}{8}$ 
- **X intercept** : $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n$ : the x intercepts occuer at 1/2 of the way between the consecutive vertical asymptotes
![[Pasted image 20260112180240.png]]
---

#### 2. Key Features and Transformations
Standard form: $y = a \tan(b(x - h)) + k$

* **Period ($P$):** For tangent and cotangent, the period is calculated as:
    $$P = \frac{\pi}{b}$$
* **Vertical Asymptotes:** These bound one full cycle of the graph.
    * For $y = \tan(bx)$, solve: $-\frac{\pi}{2} < bx < \frac{\pi}{2}$
    * For $y = \cot(bx)$, solve: $0 < bx < \pi$
* **Amplitude (Vertical Stretch):** While these functions don't have a maximum or minimum, the value of $|a|$ affects the "steepness" of the curve. The "quarter-points" of the cycle will be at $y = k + a$ and $y = k - a$.

![[Pasted image 20260112165156.png]]
- $f(x) = 2 tan(2x + 2\pi / 3) + 1$ : (pull out the 2) $f(x) = 2 tan[2(x + \pi / 3)] + 1$ : '2' tan stretches the distance between the middle/quarter/three quarter point by 2, the '+1' adds a vertical shift of one up, '2' that was pulled out is counterintuitive *horizontal compression/shrink* of a factor of 2(divide by 2 or multiply by 1/2), the $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is the phase shift and is counterintuitive because you will go $\frac{\pi}{3}$ to the *LEFT*

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Graphing Process
1.  **Find the Period:** $P = \pi/b$.
2.  **Locate Asymptotes:** Find where the function is undefined for one cycle.
3.  **Find the Midpoint:** The point exactly between the asymptotes is the x-intercept (or the point on the midline $k$).
4.  **Find Quarter-Points:** Halfway between the midpoint and each asymptote, the y-value will be $k \pm a$.
5.  **Sketch the Curve:** Draw the smooth curve approaching the asymptotes.

* **Vertical Stretch ($a$):** $1$
* **Period ($P$):** $\frac{\pi}{|b|} = \frac{\pi}{1/2} = 2\pi$
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ (Shifted left by $\frac{2\pi}{3}$)
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** $0$ (The midline is the x-axis, $y = 0$)

---

#### 2. Vertical Asymptotes (VA)
Find the boundaries for one principal cycle by setting the argument of the cotangent function equal to the standard parent asymptotes for cotangent ($0$ and $\pi$):

* **Left VA:** $$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi}{3} = 0 \implies \frac{x}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{3} \implies x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$$
* **Right VA:** $$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\pi}{3} = \pi \implies \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \implies x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$$

---

#### 3. Key Points Calculation
The period is $2\pi$. Divide this interval into four equal sections of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (or $\frac{3\pi}{6}$) each to find the critical graphing points.

| Point | x-coordinate | y-coordinate ($k$, $k \pm a$) | Final $(x, y)$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Left VA** | $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ | Undefined | VA at $x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$ |
| **Quarter Point** | $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $k + a = 0 + 1 = 1$ | $(-\frac{\pi}{6}, 1)$ |
| **Midpoint** | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $k = 0$ | $(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0)$ |
| **3/4 Point** | $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ | $k - a = 0 - 1 = -1$ | $(\frac{5\pi}{6}, -1)$ |
| **Right VA** | $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ | Undefined | VA at $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$ |

---

#### 4. Summary for Graphing
* **Midpoint (x-intercept):** $(\frac{\pi}{3}, 0)$
* **Horizontal Step Size:** $\frac{\pi}{2}$
* **Vertical Asymptotes:** $x = -\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$
* **Behavior:** The graph is decreasing between asymptotes (typical for cotangent with $a > 0$).

### Detailed Guide: Graphing Secant and Cosecant Functions

To graph these functions in detail, you must view them as the "extrapolation" of Sine and Cosine. They do not exist independently of their reciprocal guides.

---

#### 1. The Parent Graphs

**$y = \csc(x)$ (Reciprocal of Sine):**
* **Asymptotes:** $x = 0, \pi, 2\pi$ (where $\sin(x) = 0$).
* **Relative Minimum:** $( \frac{\pi}{2}, 1 )$.

---

#### 2. Standard Form & Transformations
$$y = a \csc(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \sec(b(x - h)) + k$$

| Transformation | Variable | Impact on Secant / Cosecant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vertical Stretch** | $|a|$ | Moves the vertices further from the midline. The "gap" becomes $2|a|$ units high. |
| **Period** | $P = \frac{2\pi}{b}$ | The horizontal distance between the start of one "Up-U" and the end of the next "Down-U." |
| **Phase Shift** | $h$ | Slides the starting point of the reciprocal wave left or right. |
| **Vertical Shift** | $k$ | Moves the entire graph up or down. The vertices will be at $y = k + a$ and $y = k - a$. |

---

#### 3. Deep-Dive Graphing Procedure (The "Ghost" Method)

To graph $y = a \csc(b(x - h)) + k$ with high precision:

##### Step A: Graph the "Ghost" Wave
Sketch $y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k$ lightly. 
1.  Identify the **Midline** ($y = k$).
2.  Use $a$ to find the **Amplitude** above and below the midline.
3.  Use $P = 2\pi/b$ and $h$ to find the five critical points of the Sine wave.
##### Step B: Identify Asymptotes
Draw a vertical dashed line through every point where your "Ghost" wave **crosses the midline**. 
* *Note:* If there is no vertical shift ($k=0$), these are simply the x-intercepts.

##### Step C: Plot the Vertices and Curves
1.  **Vertex Up:** At the **peaks** of the ghost wave, draw a parabola-like curve opening upward toward the asymptotes.
2.  **Vertex Down:** At the **valleys** of the ghost wave, draw a parabola-like curve opening downward toward the asymptotes.

### Finding Secant via Cosine Reciprocals on the Unit Circle

The secant function ($y = \sec \theta$) is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine function ($y = \cos \theta$). On the unit circle, this relationship allows us to derive secant values directly from coordinate points.

---

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definition
Every point on the unit circle is represented by the coordinates $(x, y)$, where:
* $x = \cos \theta$
* $y = \sin \theta$

Because $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$, it follows that on the unit circle:
$$\sec \theta = \frac{1}{x}$$

---

#### 2. Visualizing Secant Geometrically
While sine and cosine are the vertical and horizontal legs of a right triangle inside the circle, the **secant** can be visualized as a line segment on the **tangent line**:
1.  Draw a tangent line to the circle at the point $(1, 0)$.
2.  Extend the terminal side (the radius) until it hits that tangent line.
3.  The distance from the origin to that intersection point along the terminal side is the **secant length**.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step: From Cosine to Secant
To find $\sec \theta$ for any standard angle:

1.  **Identify the Cosine ($x$):** Look at the x-coordinate of the angle on the unit circle.
2.  **Take the Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction ($x \to 1/x$).
3.  **Rationalize (if necessary):** If the denominator contains a radical, multiply the top and bottom to simplify.

**Example: Finding $\sec(30^\circ)$ or $\sec(\pi/6)$**
* **Step 1:** $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* **Step 2:** $\sec(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}/2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$
* **Step 3:** $\frac{2 \times \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$

---

#### 4. Critical Values and Undefined Points
Secant becomes **undefined** whenever the x-coordinate (cosine) is $0$. This occurs at the top and bottom of the unit circle.

| Angle ($\theta$) | $\cos \theta$ ($x$) | $\sec \theta$ ($1/x$) | Point Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0$ or $0^\circ$ | $1$ | $1/1 = 1$ | Minimum Value |
| $\pi/2$ or $90^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $\pi$ or $180^\circ$ | $-1$ | $1/-1 = -1$ | Maximum Value |
| $3\pi/2$ or $270^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |

---

#### 5. Sign by Quadrant (ASTC)
Since $\sec \theta$ depends entirely on the sign of $x$ (cosine), it follows the same quadrant rules as cosine:
* **Quadrant I:** $x$ is positive $\to \sec \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant II:** $x$ is negative $\to \sec \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant III:** $x$ is negative $\to \sec \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant IV:** $x$ is positive $\to \sec \theta$ is **Positive**
### Finding Cosecant via Sine Reciprocals on the Unit Circle

The cosecant function ($y = \csc \theta$) is the reciprocal of the sine function ($y = \sin \theta$). Just as secant is tied to the horizontal $x$-coordinate, cosecant is tied to the vertical $y$-coordinate on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definition
On the unit circle (radius = 1), every point is defined by $(x, y) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. Since $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$, the value of cosecant at any angle is:
$$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{y}$$

---

#### 2. Visualizing Cosecant Geometrically
Cosecant can be visualized as a line segment related to the **vertical tangent line**:
1. Draw a horizontal tangent line to the circle at the point $(0, 1)$.
2. Extend the terminal side (the radius) until it intersects this horizontal tangent line.
3. The distance from the origin to that intersection point along the terminal side represents the **cosecant length**.

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step: From Sine to Cosecant
To find $\csc \theta$ for any standard angle:

1. **Identify the Sine ($y$):** Find the y-coordinate of the angle on the unit circle.
2. **Take the Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction ($y \to 1/y$).
3. **Rationalize (if necessary):** If the denominator contains a radical, multiply the numerator and denominator by that radical.

**Example: Finding $\csc(240^\circ)$ or $\csc(4\pi/3)$**
* **Step 1:** The y-coordinate at $240^\circ$ is $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* **Step 2:** $\csc(240^\circ) = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3}/2} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.
* **Step 3:** $-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

---

#### 4. Critical Values and Undefined Points
Cosecant becomes **undefined** whenever the y-coordinate (sine) is $0$. This occurs at the "sides" of the unit circle (the x-axis).

| Angle ($\theta$) | $\sin \theta$ ($y$) | $\csc \theta$ ($1/y$) | Point Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $0$ or $0^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $\pi/2$ or $90^\circ$ | $1$ | $1/1 = 1$ | Minimum Value |
| $\pi$ or $180^\circ$ | $0$ | $1/0 = \text{undefined}$ | **Vertical Asymptote** |
| $3\pi/2$ or $270^\circ$ | $-1$ | $1/-1 = -1$ | Maximum Value |


---

#### 5. Sign by Quadrant (ASTC)
Since $\csc \theta$ is the reciprocal of sine, it shares the exact same sign pattern as sine across the four quadrants:
* **Quadrant I:** $y$ is positive (+) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant II:** $y$ is positive (+) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Positive**
* **Quadrant III:** $y$ is negative (-) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Negative**
* **Quadrant IV:** $y$ is negative (-) $\to \csc \theta$ is **Negative**

---

#### 6. Summary Comparison for Notes
* **Secant ($1/x$):** Undefined at the top/bottom ($90^\circ, 270^\circ$).
* **Cosecant ($1/y$):** Undefined at the left/right ($0^\circ, 180^\circ$).
* **Both:** Always have values $\geq 1$ or $\leq -1$. They never exist within the "gap" between $-1$ and $1$ because sine and cosine never exceed $1$.
### Using Cosine as a Guide for Graphing Secant

The secant function, $y = \sec(x)$, is the reciprocal of the cosine function, $y = \cos(x)$. Because they are so closely linked, the most accurate way to sketch a secant graph is to first draw a "guide" or "ghost" cosine wave.

---

#### 1. The Reciprocal Relationship
Mathematically, $\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}$. This relationship dictates three critical rules for graphing:
1.  **When $\cos(x) = 1$**, $\sec(x) = 1$.
2.  **When $\cos(x) = -1$**, $\sec(x) = -1$.
3.  **When $\cos(x) = 0$**, $\sec(x)$ is **undefined** (creating a vertical asymptote).

---

#### 2. The 3-Step "Ghost Wave" Method
To graph a transformed secant function like $y = a \sec(b(x-h)) + k$:

##### Step A: Sketch the Ghost Cosine
Sketch the function $y = a \cos(b(x-h)) + k$ using a dashed line or a light color. 
* Identify the **midline** ($y = k$).
* Mark the **peaks** and **valleys** of the wave.

##### Step B: Place Vertical Asymptotes
Draw dashed vertical lines through every point where the cosine guide wave **crosses its midline**.
* In the parent function $y = \cos(x)$, the midline is the x-axis ($y=0$).
* If $\cos(x) = 0$, then $1/0$ is undefined, creating the boundary for the secant curve.

##### Step C: Sketch the Secant "Cups"
The secant graph consists of "U-shaped" curves that share the same vertices as the cosine wave but move in the opposite direction toward the asymptotes.
* **At the Peaks:** Draw a "U" opening **upward** starting from the peak of the cosine wave.
* **At the Valleys:** Draw a "U" opening **downward** starting from the valley of the cosine wave.

---

#### 3. Summary of Key Features
| Feature | Cosine Guide ($y = \cos x$) | Secant Result ($y = \sec x$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Midline Intercepts** | $(x, k)$ | **Vertical Asymptotes** |
| **Max Points (Peaks)** | $(x, k+a)$ | **Relative Minimums** of the upward "U" |
| **Min Points (Valleys)**| $(x, k-a)$ | **Relative Maximums** of the downward "U" |
| **Period** | $2\pi/b$ | $2\pi/b$ (Same as cosine) |

![[Pasted image 20260113170650.png]]‘Graphing Variations of the Secant Function :
- Replace secant with cosine and sketch the graph using a dashed curve
-  Cosine is used as a guide 
- Sketch the vertical asymptotes
- These occur at 1/4 and 3/4 of the way through the cosine cycle
- Sketch the graph by drawing the u-shaped branches between consecutive vertical asymptotes
- The "hills" and "valleys" are interchanged
- (Optional) Use the period to find additional cycles to the left or right as needed
### Using Sine as a Guide for Graphing Cosecant

The cosecant function, $y = \csc(x)$, is the reciprocal of the sine function, $y = \sin(x)$. To graph it accurately, you first sketch the corresponding sine wave as a "guide."

---

#### 1. The Reciprocal Relationship
Because $\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}$, the behavior of the cosecant graph is entirely dependent on the values of the sine wave:
* **When $\sin(x) = 1$:** $\csc(x) = 1$ (the vertex of the upward curve).
* **When $\sin(x) = -1$:** $\csc(x) = -1$ (the vertex of the downward curve).
* **When $\sin(x) = 0$:** $\csc(x)$ is **undefined**, resulting in a **vertical asymptote**.

---

#### 2. Graphing Steps (The "Ghost" Method)
For a transformed function $y = a \csc(b(x-h)) + k$:

**Step 1: Sketch the Ghost Sine Wave**
Lightly sketch $y = a \sin(b(x-h)) + k$ using a dashed line. 
* Identify the **midline** ($y = k$).
* Mark the five key points of one sine cycle (Start, Quarter, Midpoint, 3/4, End).



**Step 2: Place Vertical Asymptotes**
Draw dashed vertical lines everywhere the ghost sine wave **crosses its midline**. 
* These are the points where the reciprocal becomes $1/0$.



**Step 3: Sketch the Cosecant Curves**
Draw the cosecant "U-shapes" (often called cups) using the peaks and valleys of the sine wave as vertices:
* **At the Peaks:** Draw a "U" opening **upward** toward the asymptotes.
* **At the Valleys:** Draw a "U" opening **downward** toward the asymptotes.

---

#### 3. Key Feature Comparison
| Feature | Sine Guide ($y = \sin x$) | Cosecant Result ($y = \csc x$) |

| **Midline Intersections** | $(x, k)$ | **Vertical Asymptotes** |
| **Max Points (Peaks)** | $(x, k+a)$ | **Relative Minimums** |
| **Min Points (Valleys)** | $(x, k-a)$ | **Relative Maximums** |
| **Period** | $2\pi/b$ | $2\pi/b$ |
| **Range** | $[k-a, k+a]$ | $(-\infty, k-a] \cup [k+a, \infty)$ |

- Negative Angle Identities (Even-Odd Identities) :
  ![[Pasted image 20260114132113.png]]
### Negative Angle Identities (Even-Odd Identities)

Negative Angle Identities (also known as Even-Odd Identities) describe how a trigonometric function responds when the sign of the input angle is flipped—specifically, whether $f(-x)$ is equal to $f(x)$ or $-f(x)$.

---

#### 1. Categorization: Even vs. Odd
In mathematics, functions are categorized based on their symmetry:
* **Even Functions:** Symmetric across the **y-axis**. $f(-x) = f(x)$.
* **Odd Functions:** Symmetric about the **origin**. $f(-x) = -f(x)$.

---

#### 2. The Identities

| Function Type | Identity                        | Symmetry |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ | :------- |
| **Even**      | $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$  | y-axis   |
| **Even**      | $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$  | y-axis   |
| **Odd**       | $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$ | Origin   |
| **Odd**       | $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$ | Origin   |
| **Odd**       | $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$ | Origin   |
| **Odd**       | $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$ | Origin   |

- sin$(\theta)$ = $\frac{y}{r}$ 
- sin$(-\theta)$ = $\frac{-y}{r}$
- sin$(-\theta)$ = -sin$(\theta)$ : They are the same, but negatives of eachother
-  cos$(\theta)$ = $\frac{x}{r}$ 
-  cos$(-\theta)$ = $\frac{x}{r}$ 
- cos$(\theta)$ = cos$(-\theta)$ : They are the same, not negatives
-  -tan$(\theta)$ =  tan$(-\theta)$ : They are the same, but negatives of eachother

---

#### 3. Geometric Visualization (Unit Circle)
When you rotate an angle $\theta$ to $-\theta$, you are reflecting the terminal side across the **x-axis**.

* **Cosine (x-coordinate):** The x-value remains exactly the same for both $\theta$ and $-\theta$. This is why cosine is **even**.
* **Sine (y-coordinate):** The y-value maintains the same magnitude but flips its sign (positive becomes negative). This is why sine is **odd**.
* **Tangent (y/x):** Since the y-value flips but the x-value stays the same, the ratio $y/x$ flips its sign.

---

#### 4. Algebraic Application
These identities allow you to simplify expressions and solve for negative angles without needing to rotate clockwise on the unit circle.

**Example 1: Cosine**
$$\cos(-60^\circ) = \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Example 2: Sine**
$$\sin(-\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

**Example 3: Tangent**
$$\tan(-x) = \frac{\sin(-x)}{\cos(-x)} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = -\tan(x)$$

---

#### 5. Summary of Symmetry in Graphs
* **Cosine/Secant:** If you fold the graph along the y-axis, the left and right sides match perfectly.
* **Sine/Cosecant/Tangent/Cotangent:** If you rotate the graph $180^\circ$ around the origin, the graph looks identical.
### Trigonometry Problem: Evaluating Functions with Even-Odd Identities

**Given:**
* $\tan \theta = \frac{3}{4}$
* $\sin \theta > 0$

**Find:** $\sec \theta$, $\sin \theta$, and $\cot(-\theta)$

---

#### 1. Determine the Quadrant
* Since $\tan \theta$ is positive ($\frac{3}{4}$) and $\sin \theta$ is positive ($> 0$), the terminal side of $\theta$ must lie in **Quadrant I**.
* In Quadrant I, all trigonometric functions are positive.

#### 2. Identify Triangle Side Lengths
Using the definition $\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$:
* **Opposite ($y$):** $3$
* **Adjacent ($x$):** $4$
* **Hypotenuse ($r$):** Calculate using the Pythagorean theorem:
    $$r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

#### 3. Solve for the Requested Functions

**A. Find $\sec \theta$:**
$$\sec \theta = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{5}{4}$$

**B. Find $\sin \theta$:**
$$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3}{5}$$

**C. Find $\cot(-\theta)$:**
First, use the **Negative Angle Identity** for cotangent: $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$.
* Calculate $\cot \theta$: $\cot \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}} = \frac{4}{3}$
* Apply the identity:
$$\cot(-\theta) = -\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = -\frac{4}{3}$$

---

#### Final Results Summary
* **$\sec \theta = \frac{5}{4}$**
* **$\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}$**
* **$\cot(-\theta) = -\frac{4}{3}$**
### Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions

**Problem:** Simplify the expression $\sec \theta \cdot \cot \theta \cdot \sin \theta$

---

#### 1. Identity Substitution
To simplify, rewrite each function in terms of **Sine** and **Cosine**:

* **$\sec \theta$:** $\frac{1}{\cos \theta}$
* **$\cot \theta$:** $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
* **$\sin \theta$:** $\frac{\sin \theta}{1}$

#### 2. Algebraic Setup
Substitute these identities into the original expression:

$$\left( \frac{1}{\cos \theta} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sin \theta}{1} \right)$$

#### 3. Simplification (Cancellation)
Identify terms that appear in both the numerator and the denominator:

* The **$\cos \theta$** in the first denominator cancels with the **$\cos \theta$** in the second numerator.
* The **$\sin \theta$** in the second denominator cancels with the **$\sin \theta$** in the third numerator.

$$\frac{1}{\cancel{\cos \theta}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{\cos \theta}}{\cancel{\sin \theta}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{\sin \theta}}{1} = \frac{1}{1}$$

#### 4. Final Result
$$\sec \theta \cdot \cot \theta \cdot \sin \theta = 1$$

- Memorize the fundamental identities
- Always try to work on the more complicated side
- Express everything in terms of sine and cosine
- Perform any indicated algebraic operations such as factoring or expanding
- Use the formula for multiplying conjugates:
- (1 + sin x)(1 - sin x)
- (1 + cos x)(1 - cos x)
### Verifying Trigonometric Identities

Verifying an identity requires showing that one side of an equation is identical to the other through a series of valid substitutions and algebraic steps.

---

#### 1. Core Strategies for Verification
* **Memorize Fundamental Identities:** Recognition of reciprocal, quotient, and Pythagorean identities is the first step in substitution.
* **Work on the More Complicated Side:** It is mathematically easier to simplify a complex expression than to build up a simple one.
* **Convert to Sine and Cosine:** Rewriting terms like $\tan x$, $\sec x$, or $\cot x$ in terms of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ often reveals hidden common factors.
* **Perform Algebraic Operations:** Use standard algebra to manipulate the expression:
    * **Factoring:** Pull out common factors or use the difference of squares.
    * **Expanding:** Multiply binomials or distribute terms to simplify.
    * **Common Denominators:** Combine separate fractions into one to simplify the structure.

---

#### 2. Using Conjugates
Multiplying by a conjugate is a specific strategy used to "square" terms, which often triggers a Pythagorean identity substitution.

**Key Conjugate Formulas:**
* $(1 + \sin x)(1 - \sin x) = 1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x$
* $(1 + \cos x)(1 - \cos x) = 1 - \cos^2 x = \sin^2 x$

---

#### 3. Important Rules
* **Do Not Cross the Equals Sign:** Unlike solving equations, you must work on each side independently until they match.
* **Goal-Oriented Substitution:** Always keep an eye on the side you are *not* working on to ensure your substitutions are moving you toward that specific form.
### Trigonometric Identity Verification

**Problem:** Verify the following identity:
$$\frac{\cos x + \cot x}{\cot x} = 1 + \sin x$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we will work on the **left side**, as it is the more complicated side.

**Step 1: Separate the fraction into two terms**
By dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator, we get:
$$\frac{\cos x}{\cot x} + \frac{\cot x}{\cot x}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the second term**
Any term divided by itself is equal to 1:
$$\frac{\cos x}{\cot x} + 1$$

**Step 3: Convert the remaining trigonometric function to sine and cosine**
Substitute the identity $\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$:
$$\frac{\cos x}{\left( \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} \right)} + 1$$

**Step 4: Simplify the complex fraction**
To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
$$\cos x \cdot \left( \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \right) + 1$$

**Step 5: Cancel common factors**
The $\cos x$ terms cancel out, leaving:
$$\sin x + 1$$

**Step 6: Final Result**
Rearrange the terms to match the right side:
$$1 + \sin x$$

**The identity is verified.**
### Verifying Trigonometric Identities

**Problem:** Verify the identity shown in the final image:
$$\frac{\cot \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{\csc^2 \theta}{\tan \theta}$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification
To verify this identity, we will transform the **left side** to match the **right side** using fundamental identities.

**Step 1: Rewrite the left side using the reciprocal identity**
Recall that $\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta$.
$$\cot \theta \cdot \csc^2 \theta$$

**Step 2: Rewrite $\cot \theta$ using the quotient identity**
Recall that $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}$.
$$\frac{1}{\tan \theta} \cdot \csc^2 \theta$$

**Step 3: Combine terms**
Multiply the numerators and denominators together:
$$\frac{\csc^2 \theta}{\tan \theta}$$

**Step 4: Final Result**
The left side now identically matches the right side:
$$\frac{\csc^2 \theta}{\tan \theta} = \frac{\csc^2 \theta}{\tan \theta}$$

**The identity is verified.**

---

#### Alternative Method (Converting to Sine and Cosine)
If you prefer to work entirely in terms of sine and cosine:

1. **Left Side:** $$\frac{\cos \theta / \sin \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin^3 \theta}$$
2. **Right Side:**
   $$\frac{1 / \sin^2 \theta}{\sin \theta / \cos \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \cdot \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin^3 \theta}$$
Both sides equal $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin^3 \theta}$, confirming the identity.

### Verifying Trigonometric Identities

**Problem:** Verify the trigonometric identity:
$$-\csc^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \csc^2 \theta$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we will work on the **left side** to transform it into the right side using fundamental identities.

**Step 1: Convert the left side to Sine and Cosine**
Substitute the reciprocal identity $\csc^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}$:
$$-\left( \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \right) \cos^2 \theta$$

**Step 2: Simplify the expression**
Multiply the terms to form a single fraction:
$$-\frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta}$$

**Step 3: Recognize the Quotient Identity**
Recall that $\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \cot \theta$. Therefore:
$$-\cot^2 \theta$$

**Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Identity**
Use the identity $1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$, which can be rearranged as:
$$\cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta - 1$$
Substitute this into our expression:
$$-(\csc^2 \theta - 1)$$

**Step 5: Distribute the negative sign**
$$-\csc^2 \theta + 1$$

**Step 6: Final Result**
Rearrange the terms to match the right side:
$$1 - \csc^2 \theta$$

**The identity is verified.**
### Verifying Trigonometric Identities

**Problem:** Verify the following identity:
$$2 \tan \theta \sec \theta = \frac{1}{1 - \sin \theta} - \frac{1}{1 + \sin \theta}$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we will work on the **right side**, as it is the more complicated side.

**Step 1: Find a common denominator to combine the fractions**
The common denominator is $(1 - \sin \theta)(1 + \sin \theta)$.
$$\frac{1(1 + \sin \theta) - 1(1 - \sin \theta)}{(1 - \sin \theta)(1 + \sin \theta)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator**
Distribute the negative sign and combine like terms:
$$\frac{1 + \sin \theta - 1 + \sin \theta}{(1 - \sin \theta)(1 + \sin \theta)} = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{(1 - \sin \theta)(1 + \sin \theta)}$$

**Step 3: Simplify the denominator**
Use the formula for multiplying conjugates (difference of squares):
$$\frac{2 \sin \theta}{1 - \sin^2 \theta}$$

**Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Identity**
Substitute $1 - \sin^2 \theta$ with $\cos^2 \theta$:
$$\frac{2 \sin \theta}{\cos^2 \theta}$$

**Step 5: Deconstruct the expression into basic functions**
Separate the squared cosine in the denominator to identify the tangent and secant functions:
$$2 \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta}$$

**Step 6: Final Result**
Using the quotient identity ($\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \tan \theta$) and the reciprocal identity ($\frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \sec \theta$):
$$2 \tan \theta \sec \theta$$

**The identity is verified.**
### Verifying Trigonometric Identities

**Problem:** Verify the following identity:
$$\frac{\sec x + \tan x}{\sec x - \tan x} = \frac{1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

We will work on the **left side** of the equation to transform it into the right side.

**Step 1: Convert the left side to Sine and Cosine**
Rewrite $\sec x$ as $\frac{1}{\cos x}$ and $\tan x$ as $\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$:
$$\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1}{\cos x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the complex fraction**
Combine the terms in both the numerator and denominator:
$$\frac{\frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x}}{\frac{1 - \sin x}{\cos x}}$$
Multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:
$$\frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\cos x}{1 - \sin x} = \frac{1 + \sin x}{1 - \sin x}$$

**Step 3: Multiply by the conjugate of the denominator**
To reach the form on the right side, multiply both numerator and denominator by $(1 + \sin x)$:
$$\frac{(1 + \sin x)(1 + \sin x)}{(1 - \sin x)(1 + \sin x)}$$

**Step 4: Expand the numerator and simplify the denominator**
* **Numerator:** $(1 + \sin x)^2 = 1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x$
* **Denominator:** Use the difference of squares formula: $1 - \sin^2 x$
$$\frac{1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x}{1 - \sin^2 x}$$

**Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean Identity**
Substitute $1 - \sin^2 x$ with $\cos^2 x$:
$$\frac{1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$$

**Final Result**
The left side now identically matches the right side:
$$\frac{1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1 + 2\sin x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$$

**The identity is verified.**

- cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB : 'cos(A +B)' isn't the cosine of 'A' and 'B' it is the cosine of 'A' +Plus 'B' equals the cosine multiplied by the angles of 'A' and 'B' equals the cosine of 'A' multiplied by the cosine of 'B' minus sine of 'A' times the sine of 'B' - so, for example, if you had cos($40\degree + 35\degree$) it would be the cosine of $75\degree$ not the cosine of $40\degree + 35\degree$

### Arclength on the Unit Circle (Unit Circle Geometry)

On a **unit circle** (where the radius $r = 1$), the measure of an angle in radians is numerically equal to the length of the arc it subtends. This image illustrates how to visualize and calculate specific arclengths ($t$, $s$, and $-s$) based on terminal points.


---

#### 1. Arclength $t$
* **Starting Point:** $P_0(1, 0)$
* **Ending Point:** $Q_1(\cos t, \sin t)$
* **Explanation:** The arc $t$ represents the distance traveled along the circumference from the positive x-axis to the point $Q_1$. Because we are on a unit circle, the angle $\theta$ (in radians) at the center is exactly equal to the length of the arc.

#### 2. Arclength $s$
* **Starting Point:** $Q_1(\cos t, \sin t)$
* **Ending Point:** $P_1(\cos(s+t), \sin(s+t))$
* **Explanation:** The arc $s$ is the distance between the terminal point of $t$ and the terminal point of the combined angle $s+t$. Geometrically, this is a rotation of $s$ units starting from the position established by $t$.

#### 3. Arclength $-s$
* **Starting Point:** $P_0(1, 0)$
* **Ending Point:** $Q_0(\cos(-s), \sin(-s))$
* **Explanation:** A negative arclength indicates rotation in the **clockwise** direction. The length of the arc is $|s|$, but its position is reflected across the x-axis from a positive arc $s$.

---

#### 4. Geometric Significance: $d(P_0, P_1) = d(Q_0, Q_1)$
The image highlights a key concept used to prove the **Cosine Difference Formula**:
* The distance between $P_0$ and $P_1$ (the chord spanning arc $s+t$) is compared to the distance between $Q_0$ and $Q_1$.
* By using the distance formula on these coordinates:
    * $d(P_0, P_1) = \sqrt{(\cos(s+t) - 1)^2 + (\sin(s+t) - 0)^2}$
    * $d(Q_0, Q_1) = \sqrt{(\cos t - \cos(-s))^2 + (\sin t - \sin(-s))^2}$
* Because the arcs are equal in total magnitude, the linear distances (chords) between the points are also equal. This equality is the foundation for deriving sum and difference identities.
### Cofunction Identities & Their Derivation

Cofunction identities describe the relationship between trigonometric functions of **complementary angles** (angles that sum to $90^\circ$ or $\pi/2$ radians). The prefix "co-" in functions like **co**sine, **co**secant, and **co**tangent refers to this complementary relationship.

---

#### 1. The Six Cofunction Identities
The identities based on the provided material are:

* **Sine and Cosine:**
    * $\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta$
    * $\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta$
* **Secant and Cosecant:**
    * $\sec(90^\circ - \theta) = \csc \theta$
    * $\csc(90^\circ - \theta) = \sec \theta$
* **Tangent and Cotangent:**
    * $\tan(90^\circ - \theta) = \cot \theta$
    * $\cot(90^\circ - \theta) = \tan \theta$

---

#### 2. Geometric Derivation (Right Triangle)
The simplest way to derive these is by looking at a right triangle.

* **Complementary Angles:** In any right triangle, if one acute angle is $\theta$, the other must be $90^\circ - \theta$ because the sum of all angles is $180^\circ$.
* **Shared Sides:**
    * The side **opposite** $\theta$ is the exact same side that is **adjacent** to $(90^\circ - \theta)$.
    * The side **adjacent** to $\theta$ is the exact same side that is **opposite** $(90^\circ - \theta)$.
* **The Ratio Connection:**
    * Since $\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent to } (90^\circ - \theta)}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, they are using the same side lengths.
    * Therefore, $\sin \theta$ must equal $\cos(90^\circ - \theta)$.

---

#### 3. Algebraic Derivation (Difference Formula)
You can also derive these using the **Cosine Difference Identity**:
$$\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B$$

If we let $A = 90^\circ$ and $B = \theta$:
$$\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos 90^\circ \cos \theta + \sin 90^\circ \sin \theta$$

Substitute the known values $\cos 90^\circ = 0$ and $\sin 90^\circ = 1$:
$$\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = (0)\cos \theta + (1)\sin \theta$$
$$\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta$$

---

| Function    | Complementary Cofunction |

| **Sine**    | Cosine                   |
| **Tangent** | Cotangent                |

### 2026-January-15 - Solving $\cos(75^\circ)$ using Sum Identities

Using the **Cosine Sum Identity**: $\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$.

---

#### 1. Problem Setup
To find the exact value of $\cos(75^\circ)$, we break the angle into two "special angles" from the unit circle:
$$\cos(75^\circ) = \cos(45^\circ + 30^\circ)$$

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $s = 45^\circ$ and $t = 30^\circ$ into the sum formula:
$$\cos(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \cos 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ - \sin 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ$$

#### 3. Substitute Exact Values
Using the coordinates from the unit circle:
* $\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$

$$\cos(75^\circ) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$$

#### 4. Simplify the Expression
Multiply the fractions:
$$\cos(75^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$$

Combine over a common denominator:
$$\cos(75^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\cos(75^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$$
### Solving $\cos(\frac{\pi}{12})$ using Difference Identities

Using the **Cosine Difference Identity**: $\cos(s - t) = \cos s \cos t + \sin s \sin t$.

---

#### 1. Convert Radians to Degrees
First, we convert the radian measures to degrees for easier visualization:
* $\frac{\pi}{4} \text{ radians} = \frac{180^\circ}{4} = 45^\circ$
* $\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians} = \frac{180^\circ}{6} = 30^\circ$
* $\frac{\pi}{12} \text{ radians} = \frac{180^\circ}{12} = 15^\circ$

So, finding $\cos(\frac{\pi}{12})$ is equivalent to finding $\cos(45^\circ - 30^\circ)$.

---

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $s = 45^\circ$ and $t = 30^\circ$ into the difference formula:
$$\cos(45^\circ - 30^\circ) = \cos 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ$$



---

#### 3. Substitute Exact Values
From the unit circle:
* $\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$

$$\cos(15^\circ) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$$

---

#### 4. Simplify the Expression
Multiply the terms:
$$\cos(15^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$$

Combine over a common denominator:
$$\cos(15^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}$$
### Simplifying Expressions with Cosine Difference Identity

**Problem:** Simplify and evaluate the expression:
$$\cos 83^\circ \cos 38^\circ + \sin 83^\circ \sin 38^\circ$$

---

#### 1. Identify the Identity
The expression follows the specific pattern of the **Cosine Difference Identity**:
$$\cos(s - t) = \cos s \cos t + \sin s \sin t$$

In this case:
* $s = 83^\circ$
* $t = 38^\circ$

#### 2. Condense the Expression
By applying the identity in reverse, we can condense the long expression into a single cosine function:
$$\cos(83^\circ - 38^\circ)$$

#### 3. Subtract the Angles
Perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:
$$83 - 38 = 45$$
So, the expression simplifies to:
$$\cos(45^\circ)$$

#### 4. Find the Exact Value
Using the unit circle, we identify the exact value for a $45^\circ$ angle:
$$\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\cos 83^\circ \cos 38^\circ + \sin 83^\circ \sin 38^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
### Solving Equations with Cofunction Identities

**Problem:** Find an angle $\theta$ that satisfies the equation:
$$\sin \theta = \cos(-55^\circ)$$

---

#### 1. Identify the Relevant Identity
To solve an equation where a **Sine** function equals a **Cosine** function, we use the **Cofunction Identity**:
$$\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$$

#### 2. Set Up the Equation
By substituting the identity into the original problem, we can rewrite the left side so both sides of the equation use the same trigonometric function (Cosine):
$$\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos(-55^\circ)$$

#### 3. Solve for $\theta$
Since the Cosine functions are equal, their arguments must also be equal:
$$90^\circ - \theta = -55^\circ$$

**Step-by-step algebra:**
* Subtract $90^\circ$ from both sides:
$$-\theta = -55^\circ - 90^\circ$$
* Combine the terms:
$$-\theta = -145^\circ$$
* Multiply by $-1$ to isolate $\theta$:
$$\theta = 145^\circ$$


---

#### Final Result
The angle that satisfies the equation is **$\theta = 145^\circ$**.
### Verifying Identities with Sum Formulas

**Problem:** Verify the following identity:
$$\cos(\theta + \pi) = -\cos \theta$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we apply the **Cosine Sum Identity**:
$$\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$$

**Step 1: Assign variables**
Let $s = \theta$ and $t = \pi$.

**Step 2: Substitute into the sum formula**
$$\cos(\theta + \pi) = \cos \theta \cos \pi - \sin \theta \sin \pi$$

**Step 3: Evaluate constant trigonometric values**
Using the unit circle, we know the values for the angle $\pi$ ($180^\circ$):
* $\cos \pi = -1$
* $\sin \pi = 0$


**Step 4: Substitute and simplify**
Substitute these values back into our expression:
$$\cos(\theta + \pi) = \cos \theta (-1) - \sin \theta (0)$$

**Step 5: Final Result**
The term involving sine becomes zero, leaving:
$$\cos(\theta + \pi) = -\cos \theta$$

**The identity is verified.**

---

#### Geometric Interpretation
Adding $\pi$ ($180^\circ$) to any angle $\theta$ results in a point on the unit circle that is directly opposite the original point. Since $\cos \theta$ represents the $x$-coordinate, rotating by half a circle flips the sign of the $x$-coordinate while maintaining the same absolute value.
### Double-Angle Identity Verification

**Problem:** Verify the following double-angle identity:
$$\cos^2 x - \sin^2 x = \cos 2x$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we start with the **Cosine Sum Identity** and apply it to an angle doubled ($x + x$).

**Step 1: Use the Cosine Sum Identity**
Recall the fundamental sum formula:
$$\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$$

**Step 2: Substitute $x$ for both $s$ and $t$**
To find the identity for $2x$, we let $s = x$ and $t = x$:
$$\cos(x + x) = \cos x \cos x - \sin x \sin x$$

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**
* Multiplying $\cos x$ by itself gives $\cos^2 x$.
* Multiplying $\sin x$ by itself gives $\sin^2 x$.
$$\cos 2x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x$$

---

#### Alternative Forms (Using Pythagorean Identities)
By substituting $\sin^2 x = 1 - \cos^2 x$ or $\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x$, we can derive two other common versions of this identity:

1.  **In terms of Cosine only:**
    $$\cos 2x = 2\cos^2 x - 1$$
2.  **In terms of Sine only:**
    $$\cos 2x = 1 - 2\sin^2 x$$


---

#### Final Result
The identity is verified through the sum formula:
$$\cos^2 x - \sin^2 x = \cos 2x$$
### Solving for $\cos(s + t)$ with Quadrant Constraints

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\cos(s + t)$ given:
* $s$ is in Quadrant I (**QI**) and $\sin s = \frac{3}{5}$
* $t$ is in Quadrant III (**QIII**) and $\sin t = -\frac{12}{13}$

---

#### 1. Identify the Relevant Identity
To find $\cos(s + t)$, we must use the **Cosine Sum Identity**:
$$\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$$

We already have $\sin s$ and $\sin t$. We need to find $\cos s$ and $\cos t$ using the Pythagorean Identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$).

#### 2. Find Missing Values

**Find $\cos s$ (Quadrant I):**
In QI, cosine is **positive**.
$$\cos^2 s = 1 - \sin^2 s \implies \cos^2 s = 1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2$$
$$\cos^2 s = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25}$$
$$\cos s = \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{4}{5}$$

**Find $\cos t$ (Quadrant III):**
In QIII, cosine is **negative**.
$$\cos^2 t = 1 - \sin^2 t \implies \cos^2 t = 1 - \left(-\frac{12}{13}\right)^2$$
$$\cos^2 t = 1 - \frac{144}{169} = \frac{25}{169}$$
$$\cos t = -\sqrt{\frac{25}{169}} = -\frac{5}{13}$$

---

#### 3. Substitute into the Identity
Now, plug all four values into the sum formula:
$$\cos(s + t) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{5}{13}\right) - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{12}{13}\right)$$

**Step-by-step calculation:**
* First term: $\frac{4 \cdot -5}{5 \cdot 13} = -\frac{20}{65}$
* Second term: $\frac{3 \cdot -12}{5 \cdot 13} = -\frac{36}{65}$

$$\cos(s + t) = -\frac{20}{65} - \left(-\frac{36}{65}\right)$$
$$\cos(s + t) = -\frac{20}{65} + \frac{36}{65}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\cos(s + t) = \frac{16}{65}$$
## 2026-January-16 - Sum and Difference Identities for Sine and Tangent :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=8h31m25s
- sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB : signs are the same for this one 
- sin(A - B) = sinA cos B -cosA sinB
### Sum and Difference Identities for Sine and Tangent

Following our previous work on cosine identities, these formulas allow us to find the exact values of sine and tangent for angles that are not directly on the unit circle by breaking them into sums or differences of special angles ($30^\circ, 45^\circ, 60^\circ$).

---

#### 1. Sine Sum and Difference Identities
Unlike the cosine identities, the sine formulas maintain the same sign between the terms.

* **Sum Identity:** $\sin(s + t) = \sin s \cos t + \cos s \sin t$
* **Difference Identity:** $\sin(s - t) = \sin s \cos t - \cos s \sin t$

**Key Observation:** Notice that the sine formula "mixes" the functions ($\sin \cdot \cos$) in each term, whereas the cosine formula keeps them grouped ($\cos \cdot \cos$ and $\sin \cdot \sin$).

---

#### 2. Tangent Sum and Difference Identities
These identities are expressed as fractions and can be derived by dividing the sine identity by the cosine identity ($\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$).

* **Sum Identity:** $\tan(s + t) = \frac{\tan s + \tan t}{1 - \tan s \tan t}$
* **Difference Identity:** $\tan(s - t) = \frac{\tan s - \tan t}{1 + \tan s \tan t}$

---

#### 3. Summary of Strategies
When using these identities for your notes, remember these common steps:

* **Quadrant Check:** Always verify which quadrant the angle falls in to determine if the result should be positive or negative.
* **Special Angles:** Look for ways to combine $30^\circ, 45^\circ,$ and $60^\circ$ (or their radian equivalents) to reach your target angle.
* **Pythagorean Identities:** If you are given $\sin s$ but need $\cos s$ to complete the formula, use $\sin^2 s + \cos^2 s = 1$ to find the missing value.

#### 4. Practical Application Table
| To Find | Use This Combination | Identity Applied |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\sin(75^\circ)$** | $45^\circ + 30^\circ$ | Sine Sum |
| **$\sin(15^\circ)$** | $45^\circ - 30^\circ$ | Sine Difference |
| **$\tan(105^\circ)$** | $60^\circ + 45^\circ$ | Tangent Sum |
### Sum and Difference Identities for Tangent

Tangent sum and difference identities are essential tools for finding the exact values of angles that are not represented directly on the unit circle by combining known "special angles".

---

#### 1. The Identities
The formulas for the tangent of a sum or difference of two angles, $A$ and $B$, are expressed as follows:

* **Tangent Sum Identity:**
    $$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$$
* **Tangent Difference Identity:**
    $$\tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}$$

---

#### 2. Derivation of the Sum Identity
The tangent identities can be derived algebraically by using the fundamental relationship $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$ and applying the sum identities for sine and cosine.

**Step 1: Express Tangent in terms of Sine and Cosine**
$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)}$$

**Step 2: Apply the Sine and Cosine Sum Formulas**
Substitute the known sum identities:
* $\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$
* $\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$

$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}$$

**Step 3: Normalize the expression**
To transform this into an expression involving only tangents, divide every term in both the numerator and the denominator by $(\cos A \cos B)$:
$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\frac{\sin A \cos B}{\cos A \cos B} + \frac{\cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B}}{\frac{\cos A \cos B}{\cos A \cos B} - \frac{\sin A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B}}$$

**Step 4: Simplify to Tangent ratios**
Cancel common factors and recognize that $\frac{\sin}{\cos} = \tan$:
* $\frac{\sin A \cos B}{\cos A \cos B} \rightarrow \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \tan A$
* $\frac{\cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B} \rightarrow \frac{\sin B}{\cos B} = \tan B$
* $\frac{\sin A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B} \rightarrow \tan A \tan B$

This results in the final formula:
$$\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$$

#### 3. Derivation of the Difference Identity
The difference identity is derived using a similar process by substituting $(-B)$ into the sum identity and utilizing the fact that tangent is an **odd function** ($\tan(-B) = -\tan B$).

### Solving $\sin(165^\circ)$ using Sum Identities

Using the **Sine Sum Identity**: $\sin(s + t) = \sin s \cos t + \cos s \sin t$.

---

#### 1. Problem Setup
To find the exact value of $\sin(165^\circ)$, we break the angle into two special angles from the unit circle. A common combination is:
$$\sin(165^\circ) = \sin(120^\circ + 45^\circ)$$

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $s = 120^\circ$ and $t = 45^\circ$ into the sum formula:
$$\sin(120^\circ + 45^\circ) = \sin 120^\circ \cos 45^\circ + \cos 120^\circ \sin 45^\circ$$

#### 3. Substitute Exact Values
Using the coordinates from the unit circle:
* $\sin 120^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos 120^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}$
* $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

$$\sin(165^\circ) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$$

#### 4. Simplify the Expression
Multiply the fractions:
$$\sin(165^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \right)$$

Combine over a common denominator:
$$\sin(165^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\sin(165^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$$
### Simplifying Expressions with Sine Difference Identity

**Problem:** Simplify the following expression:
$$\sin 3\theta \cos(-2\theta) - \cos 3\theta \sin(-2\theta)$$

---

#### 1. Identify the Identity
The expression follows the specific structure of the **Sine Difference Identity**:
$$\sin(s - t) = \sin s \cos t - \cos s \sin t$$

In this case:
* $s = 3\theta$
* $t = -2\theta$

#### 2. Condense the Expression
By applying the identity in reverse, we can condense the entire expression into a single sine function:
$$\sin(3\theta - (-2\theta))$$

#### 3. Simplify the Argument
Subtracting a negative is the same as adding:
$$\sin(3\theta + 2\theta)$$
$$\sin(5\theta)$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\sin 3\theta \cos(-2\theta) - \cos 3\theta \sin(-2\theta) = \sin 5\theta$$
### Solving $\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right)$ using Difference Identities

To find the exact value of $\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right)$, we use the **Tangent Difference Identity**:
$$\tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}$$

---

#### 1. Problem Setup & Conversion
First, we break $\frac{\pi}{12}$ into two special angles that we know from the unit circle.
* $\frac{\pi}{12}$ is equivalent to $15^\circ$.
* We can use $\frac{\pi}{4} (45^\circ)$ and $\frac{\pi}{6} (30^\circ)$ because $\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{3\pi}{12} - \frac{2\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{12}$.

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $A = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $B = \frac{\pi}{6}$ into the formula:
$$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\tan\frac{\pi}{4} - \tan\frac{\pi}{6}}{1 + \tan\frac{\pi}{4} \tan\frac{\pi}{6}}$$

#### 3. Substitute Exact Values
From the unit circle:
* $\tan\frac{\pi}{4} = 1$
* $\tan\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$

$$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{1 + (1)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)}$$

#### 4. Simplify the Expression
To clear the fractions within the fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by $3$:
$$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{3 + \sqrt{3}}$$

**Rationalizing the denominator** (multiplying by the conjugate $3 - \sqrt{3}$):
$$\frac{(3 - \sqrt{3})(3 - \sqrt{3})}{(3 + \sqrt{3})(3 - \sqrt{3})} = \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{9 - 3}$$
$$\frac{12 - 6\sqrt{3}}{6}$$

Divide each term by $6$:
$$2 - \sqrt{3}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = 2 - \sqrt{3}$$
### Verifying Complex Identities with Sum Formulas

**Problem:** Verify the following identity:
$$\cos \beta = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6} + \beta\right) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + \beta\right)$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we expand both terms on the right side using the **Sine Sum Identity** and the **Cosine Sum Identity**.

**1. Expand the Sine term:**
Using the identity $\sin(s + t) = \sin s \cos t + \cos s \sin t$:
* $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6} + \beta\right) = \sin\frac{\pi}{6} \cos \beta + \cos\frac{\pi}{6} \sin \beta$
* Substitute exact values ($\sin\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\cos\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$):
* $= \frac{1}{2}\cos \beta + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta$

**2. Expand the Cosine term:**
Using the identity $\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$:
* $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + \beta\right) = \cos\frac{\pi}{3} \cos \beta - \sin\frac{\pi}{3} \sin \beta$
* Substitute exact values ($\cos\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\sin\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$):
* $= \frac{1}{2}\cos \beta - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta$

**3. Combine and Simplify:**
Add the two expanded results together:
$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\cos \beta + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\cos \beta - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta\right)$$

The sine terms ($+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta$ and $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin \beta$) are additive inverses and cancel out:
* $\frac{1}{2}\cos \beta + \frac{1}{2}\cos \beta$
* $= 1 \cdot \cos \beta$
* $= \cos \beta$

---

#### Final Result
The right side simplifies exactly to the left side:
$$\cos \beta = \cos \beta$$
**The identity is verified.**
### Solving for $\sin(\theta + \beta)$ and $\tan(\theta + \beta)$

**Problem:** Given the following values and quadrant constraints, find $\sin(\theta + \beta)$, $\tan(\theta + \beta)$, and the quadrant of $\theta + \beta$.
* $\sin \theta = \frac{4}{5}$, where $\theta$ is in Quadrant II (**QII**)
* $\cos \beta = -\frac{5}{13}$, where $\beta$ is in Quadrant III (**QIII**)

---

#### 1. Find Missing Trigonometric Ratios
We need all components for the sum identities: $\sin \theta, \cos \theta, \tan \theta$ and $\sin \beta, \cos \beta, \tan \beta$.

**For $\theta$ (QII):**
* $\sin \theta = \frac{4}{5}$ (Given)
* $\cos \theta = -\sqrt{1 - (\frac{4}{5})^2} = -\sqrt{\frac{9}{25}} = -\frac{3}{5}$ (Negative in QII)
* $\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{4/5}{-3/5} = -\frac{4}{3}$

**For $\beta$ (QIII):**
* $\cos \beta = -\frac{5}{13}$ (Given)
* $\sin \beta = -\sqrt{1 - (-\frac{5}{13})^2} = -\sqrt{\frac{144}{169}} = -\frac{12}{13}$ (Negative in QIII)
* $\tan \beta = \frac{\sin \beta}{\cos \beta} = \frac{-12/13}{-5/13} = \frac{12}{5}$

---

#### 2. Calculate $\sin(\theta + \beta)$
Using the identity $\sin(\theta + \beta) = \sin \theta \cos \beta + \cos \theta \sin \beta$:
$$\sin(\theta + \beta) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{5}{13}\right) + \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{12}{13}\right)$$
$$\sin(\theta + \beta) = -\frac{20}{65} + \frac{36}{65} = \frac{16}{65}$$

#### 3. Calculate $\tan(\theta + \beta)$
Using the identity $\tan(\theta + \beta) = \frac{\tan \theta + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \theta \tan \beta}$:
$$\tan(\theta + \beta) = \frac{-\frac{4}{3} + \frac{12}{5}}{1 - (-\frac{4}{3})(\frac{12}{5})} = \frac{\frac{-20 + 36}{15}}{1 + \frac{48}{15}} = \frac{\frac{16}{15}}{\frac{63}{15}}$$
$$\tan(\theta + \beta) = \frac{16}{63}$$

#### 4. Identify the Quadrant of $\theta + \beta$
* $\sin(\theta + \beta) = \frac{16}{65}$ (**Positive**)
* $\tan(\theta + \beta) = \frac{16}{63}$ (**Positive**)
* Since $\tan = \frac{\sin}{\cos}$, and both are positive, $\cos(\theta + \beta)$ must also be **positive**.


**Result:** The angle $\theta + \beta$ lies in **Quadrant I**.

---

#### Final Results
* **$\sin(\theta + \beta) = \frac{16}{65}$**
* **$\tan(\theta + \beta) = \frac{16}{63}$**
* **Quadrant: I**

### Double-Angle Identities: Derivations, Applications, and Examples

Double-angle identities allow us to express trigonometric functions of twice an angle ($2A$) in terms of functions of the original angle ($A$). These are essential for simplifying complex expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and performing calculus operations.

---

#### 1. The Core Identities
Based on your course materials, here are the primary double-angle identities:

* **Sine:**
    * $\sin 2A = 2 \sin A \cos A$
* **Cosine (Three Forms):**
    * $\cos 2A = \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A$
    * $\cos 2A = 2 \cos^2 A - 1$
    * $\cos 2A = 1 - 2 \sin^2 A$
* **Tangent:**
    * $\tan 2A = \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}$

---

#### 2. Derivation from Sum Identities
Every double-angle identity is derived by using the **Sum Identities** and treating $2A$ as the sum $(A + A)$.

**Deriving $\sin 2A$:**
1. Start with the sine sum formula: $\sin(s + t) = \sin s \cos t + \cos s \sin t$.
2. Substitute $A$ for both $s$ and $t$: $\sin(A + A) = \sin A \cos A + \cos A \sin A$.
3. Combine like terms: $\sin 2A = 2 \sin A \cos A$.

**Deriving $\cos 2A$:**
1. Start with the cosine sum formula: $\cos(s + t) = \cos s \cos t - \sin s \sin t$.
2. Substitute $A$ for both $s$ and $t$: $\cos(A + A) = \cos A \cos A - \sin A \sin A$.
3. Simplify: $\cos 2A = \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A$.
   *To reach the other forms, substitute the Pythagorean identity ($\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$) into this result.*

**Deriving $\tan 2A$:**
1. Start with the tangent sum formula: $\tan(s + t) = \frac{\tan s + \tan t}{1 - \tan s \tan t}$.
2. Substitute $A$ for both $s$ and $t$: $\tan(A + A) = \frac{\tan A + \tan A}{1 - \tan A \tan A}$.
3. Simplify: $\tan 2A = \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}$.

---

#### 3. Practical Applications
* **Simplification:** Consolidate products of sine and cosine into a single term.
* **Solving Equations:** Rewrite equations containing both $x$ and $2x$ in terms of a single angle to allow for factoring.
* **Calculus Integration:** Use the cosine double-angle forms to reduce powers (e.g., converting $\sin^2 x$ into a linear function of $2x$).

---

#### 4. Worked Example: Finding Exact Values
**Problem:** Given that $\cos A = -\frac{3}{5}$ and angle $A$ is in Quadrant II (**QII**), find the exact value of $\sin 2A$.

**Step 1: Find $\sin A$**
In QII, sine is positive. Using the Pythagorean identity:
$\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{25}} = \frac{4}{5}$.

**Step 2: Apply the Double-Angle Identity**
Substitute the values into $\sin 2A = 2 \sin A \cos A$:
$$\sin 2A = 2 \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right)$$

**Step 3: Solve**
$$\sin 2A = -\frac{24}{25}$$

### Product-to-Sum Identities: Derivations and Applications

Product-to-sum identities allow us to rewrite the product of two trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) as a sum or difference of trigonometric functions. This is particularly useful in calculus and advanced trigonometry.

---

#### 1. The Identities
The four primary product-to-sum identities are:

* **Sine $\times$ Cosine:** $\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(A + B) + \sin(A - B)]$
* **Cosine $\times$ Sine:** $\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(A + B) - \sin(A - B)]$
* **Cosine $\times$ Cosine:** $\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(A + B) + \cos(A - B)]$
* **Sine $\times$ Sine:** $\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]$

---

#### 2. Derivations
These identities are derived by adding or subtracting the standard **Sum and Difference Identities**.

**Example Derivation for $\cos A \cos B$:**
1.  Recall the Cosine Sum and Difference formulas:
    * (1) $\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B$
    * (2) $\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B$
2.  Add equation (1) and equation (2):
    $$\cos(A - B) + \cos(A + B) = 2 \cos A \cos B$$
    *(Notice the $\sin A \sin B$ terms cancel out)*
3.  Divide by 2 to isolate the product:
    $$\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(A - B) + \cos(A + B)]$$

---

#### 3. When to Use Them
* **Calculus Integration:** In calculus, it is often impossible to integrate a product like $\int \sin(5x)\cos(3x)dx$ directly. Converting it to a sum makes it easy to integrate each term separately.
* **Signal Processing:** To analyze interference patterns or beat frequencies where two waves are multiplied together.
* **Simplification:** When you need to combine terms in a trigonometric equation to solve for a variable.

---

#### 4. Worked Example
**Problem:** Rewrite $\sin(4\theta)\sin(2\theta)$ as a sum or difference.

**Step 1: Identify the correct identity**
We use the Sine $\times$ Sine identity: $\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]$.
Here, $A = 4\theta$ and $B = 2\theta$.

**Step 2: Substitute and Solve**
$$\sin(4\theta)\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(4\theta - 2\theta) - \cos(4\theta + 2\theta)]$$
$$\sin(4\theta)\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(2\theta) - \cos(6\theta)]$$

### Finding Double-Angle Values from Single-Angle Data

**Problem:** Given the following values, find the exact values of $\sin 2\theta$, $\cos 2\theta$, and $\tan 2\theta$.
* $\cos \theta = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$
* $\sin \theta > 0$

---

#### 1. Determine the Quadrant and Find $\sin \theta$
Since $\cos \theta$ is positive and $\sin \theta$ is positive, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant I**. 

Use the Pythagorean identity to find $\sin \theta$:
$$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$$
$$\sin^2 \theta + \left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^2 = 1$$
$$\sin^2 \theta + \frac{8}{9} = 1$$
$$\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{9} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{3} \text{ (Positive in QI)}$$

---

#### 2. Calculate $\sin 2\theta$
Using the identity $\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta$:
$$\sin 2\theta = 2 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)$$
$$\sin 2\theta = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{9}$$

#### 3. Calculate $\cos 2\theta$
Using the identity $\cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta$:
$$\cos 2\theta = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2$$
$$\cos 2\theta = \frac{8}{9} - \frac{1}{9}$$
$$\cos 2\theta = \frac{7}{9}$$

#### 4. Calculate $\tan 2\theta$
Using the ratio relationship $\tan 2\theta = \frac{\sin 2\theta}{\cos 2\theta}$:
$$\tan 2\theta = \frac{\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{9}}{\frac{7}{9}}$$
$$\tan 2\theta = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{7}$$


---

#### Final Results
* **$\sin 2\theta = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{9}$**
* **$\cos 2\theta = \frac{7}{9}$**
* **$\tan 2\theta = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{7}$**
### Finding $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ from $\cos 2\theta$

**Problem:** Given the following value and quadrant constraint, find the exact values of $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$.
* $\cos 2\theta = -\frac{7}{25}$
* $\theta$ is in Quadrant IV (**QIV**)

---

#### 1. Choose the Appropriate Double-Angle Identity
To find $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$, we can use the versions of the cosine double-angle identity that isolate a single function.

* **To find $\cos \theta$:** Use $\cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$
* **To find $\sin \theta$:** Use $\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta$

---

#### 2. Solve for $\cos \theta$
Using the identity $\cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$:
$$-\frac{7}{25} = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$$

**Step-by-step algebra:**
* Add 1 to both sides:
$$1 - \frac{7}{25} = 2 \cos^2 \theta \implies \frac{18}{25} = 2 \cos^2 \theta$$
* Divide by 2:
$$\frac{9}{25} = \cos^2 \theta$$
* Take the square root:
$$\cos \theta = \pm \frac{3}{5}$$

**Determine Sign:** Since $\theta$ is in **Quadrant IV**, cosine must be **positive**.
$$\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}$$

---

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$
Using the identity $\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta$:
$$-\frac{7}{25} = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta$$

**Step-by-step algebra:**
* Subtract 1 from both sides:
$$-\frac{7}{25} - \frac{25}{25} = -2 \sin^2 \theta \implies -\frac{32}{25} = -2 \sin^2 \theta$$
* Divide by -2:
$$\frac{16}{25} = \sin^2 \theta$$
* Take the square root:
$$\sin \theta = \pm \frac{4}{5}$$

**Determine Sign:** Since $\theta$ is in **Quadrant IV**, sine must be **negative**.
$$\sin \theta = -\frac{4}{5}$$


---

#### Final Results
* **$\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}$**
* **$\sin \theta = -\frac{4}{5}$**
### Verifying Identities with Double-Angle Formulas

**Problem:** Verify the following trigonometric identity:
$$\cot x (1 - \cos 2x) = \sin 2x$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we will transform the left side of the equation to see if it matches the right side.

**1. Substitute the Double-Angle Identity for $\cos 2x$**
We need to pick the form of $\cos 2x$ that will help cancel the "$1$". Using $\cos 2x = 1 - 2 \sin^2 x$ is the most efficient choice:
$$\cot x [1 - (1 - 2 \sin^2 x)]$$

**2. Simplify the Brackets**
Distribute the negative sign:
$$\cot x (1 - 1 + 2 \sin^2 x)$$
$$\cot x (2 \sin^2 x)$$

**3. Rewrite $\cot x$ using Quotient Identities**
Recall that $\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$:
$$\left( \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} \right) (2 \sin^2 x)$$

**4. Cancel and Multiply**
One $\sin x$ in the denominator cancels with one in the numerator:
$$2 \cos x \sin x$$
$$2 \sin x \cos x$$


**5. Recognize the Sine Double-Angle Identity**
From our identities list, we know that $2 \sin x \cos x = \sin 2x$.

---

#### Final Result
The left side simplifies exactly to the right side:
$$\sin 2x = \sin 2x$$
**The identity is verified.**
### Verifying Identities with Double-Angle Formulas

**Problem:** Verify the following trigonometric identity:
$$1 + \cos 2x = \cot x \sin 2x$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, we will transform the expression on the right side to see if it simplifies to match the left side.

**1. Substitute the identities for $\cot x$ and $\sin 2x$**
On the right side, rewrite $\cot x$ using the **Quotient Identity** and $\sin 2x$ using the **Double-Angle Identity**:
* $\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$
* $\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x$

Substitute these into the right side:
$$\left( \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} \right) (2 \sin x \cos x)$$

**2. Simplify the Expression**
The $\sin x$ in the denominator cancels with the $\sin x$ in the numerator:
$$\cos x (2 \cos x)$$
$$2 \cos^2 x$$

**3. Relate back to the Double-Angle Identity for Cosine**
From our core identities, we know that one form of the **Cosine Double-Angle Identity** is:
$$\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1$$

If we isolate $2 \cos^2 x$ by adding $1$ to both sides, we get:
$$1 + \cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x$$

---

#### Final Result
The right side simplifies exactly to the left side:
$$1 + \cos 2x = 1 + \cos 2x$$
**The identity is verified.**
### Solving $2 \sin 105^\circ \cos 75^\circ$ using Product-to-Sum Identities

**Problem:** Find the exact value of the expression $2 \sin 105^\circ \cos 75^\circ$.

---

#### 1. Identify the Correct Identity
The expression follows the form of the **Sine $\times$ Cosine Product-to-Sum Identity**:
$$\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(A + B) + \sin(A - B)]$$

In this problem:
* $A = 105^\circ$
* $B = 75^\circ$

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute the angles into the formula. Note that the "$2$" in your original expression will cancel out with the "$\frac{1}{2}$" in the identity:
$$2 \sin 105^\circ \cos 75^\circ = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} [\sin(105^\circ + 75^\circ) + \sin(105^\circ - 75^\circ)]$$
$$= \sin(180^\circ) + \sin(30^\circ)$$

#### 3. Substitute Exact Values
Using the unit circle values for these special angles:
* $\sin 180^\circ = 0$
* $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$

$$0 + \frac{1}{2}$$

---

#### Final Result
$$2 \sin 105^\circ \cos 75^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$$
### Simplifying $\cos 13\theta - \cos 5\theta$ using Sum-to-Product Identities

To rewrite the difference of two cosine functions as a product, we use the **Sum-to-Product Identity**:
$$\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)$$

---

#### 1. Identify the Angles
From your image, we have:
* $A = 13\theta$
* $B = 5\theta$

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $A$ and $B$ into the formula:
$$\cos 13\theta - \cos 5\theta = -2 \sin\left(\frac{13\theta + 5\theta}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{13\theta - 5\theta}{2}\right)$$

#### 3. Simplify the Arguments
Perform the arithmetic inside the parentheses:
* **Sum term:** $\frac{13\theta + 5\theta}{2} = \frac{18\theta}{2} = 9\theta$
* **Difference term:** $\frac{13\theta - 5\theta}{2} = \frac{8\theta}{2} = 4\theta$

---

#### Final Result
$$\cos 13\theta - \cos 5\theta = -2 \sin 9\theta \sin 4\theta$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=9h23m30s
### Half-Angle Identities: Derivations and Applications

Half-angle identities allow us to find the trigonometric values of an angle $\frac{A}{2}$ if we know the value of $\cos A$. These are particularly useful for finding exact values of angles that are half of the "special angles" on the unit circle (e.g., $15^\circ$ is half of $30^\circ$).

---

#### 1. The Half-Angle Identities
The primary identities for sine, cosine, and tangent are:

* **Sine:** $$\sin \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{2}}$$
* **Cosine:** $$\cos \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}$$
* **Tangent (Three Forms):**
  1. $\tan \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{1 + \cos A}}$
  2. $\tan \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sin A}{1 + \cos A}$
  3. $\tan \frac{A}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos A}{\sin A}$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The $\pm$ Sign:** The choice of $+$ or $-$ is determined by the **quadrant** in which the half-angle $\frac{A}{2}$ lies, not the quadrant of $A$.

---

#### 2. Derivations
Half-angle identities are derived directly from the **Double-Angle Identities** for cosine.

**Deriving Sine Half-Angle:**
1. Start with the double-angle formula: $\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta$.
2. Let $2\theta = A$, which means $\theta = \frac{A}{2}$:
   $$\cos A = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \frac{A}{2}$$
3. Rearrange to solve for $\sin \frac{A}{2}$:
   $$2 \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 - \cos A$$
   $$\sin \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{2}}$$

**Deriving Cosine Half-Angle:**
1. Start with the double-angle formula: $\cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1$.
2. Let $2\theta = A$, which means $\theta = \frac{A}{2}$:
   $$\cos A = 2 \cos^2 \frac{A}{2} - 1$$
3. Rearrange to solve for $\cos \frac{A}{2}$:
   $$2 \cos^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 + \cos A$$
   $$\cos \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}$$



---

#### 3. Worked Example
**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\cos 15^\circ$.

**Step 1: Identify the relationship**
$15^\circ$ is half of $30^\circ$. So, $A = 30^\circ$.

**Step 2: Choose the identity and sign**
Since $15^\circ$ is in **Quadrant I**, the cosine value must be **positive**.
$$\cos 15^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 30^\circ}{2}}$$

**Step 3: Substitute and simplify**
Know that $\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$:
$$\cos 15^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{4}}$$
$$\cos 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{2}$$

---

#### 4. Summary Table
| Function | Formula | Key Step |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sine** | $\pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos A}{2}}$ | Use the quadrant of $\frac{A}{2}$ for sign |
| **Cosine** | $\pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}$ | Use the quadrant of $\frac{A}{2}$ for sign |
| **Tangent** | $\frac{1 - \cos A}{\sin A}$ | Most common form (no $\pm$ needed) |
### Finding the Exact Value of $\cos 67.5^\circ$

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\cos 67.5^\circ$ using the Half-Angle Identities.

---

#### 1. Identify the Relationship
The angle $67.5^\circ$ is exactly half of $135^\circ$ ($135^\circ / 2 = 67.5^\circ$). Since $135^\circ$ is a special angle on the unit circle, we can use the **Cosine Half-Angle Identity**.

#### 2. Choose the Identity and Determine the Sign
* **Identity:** $\cos \frac{A}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}$
* **Quadrant Check:** $67.5^\circ$ is in **Quadrant I**, where cosine is **positive**. Therefore, we will use the positive root.

#### 3. Substitute and Solve
Set $A = 135^\circ$:
$$\cos 67.5^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 135^\circ}{2}}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the exact value of $\cos 135^\circ$**
Recall that $\cos 135^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$:
$$\cos 67.5^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{1 + (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})}{2}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator**
Find a common denominator inside the square root:
$$\cos 67.5^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}}$$

**Step 3: Final Simplification**
Divide by 2 (which is the same as multiplying the denominator by 2):
$$\cos 67.5^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{4}}$$
$$\cos 67.5^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}$$

---

#### Final Result
**$\cos 67.5^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}$**
### Finding the Exact Value of $\tan \frac{7\pi}{12}$ (Degree Conversion Method)

**Problem:** Convert $\frac{7\pi}{12}$ to degrees and find its exact value using Half-Angle Identities.

---

#### 1. Convert Radians to Degrees
To convert from radians to degrees, multiply the angle by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$:
$$\frac{7\pi}{12} \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{7 \cdot 180^\circ}{12}$$
$$7 \cdot 15^\circ = 105^\circ$$

Now the problem is to find the exact value of **$\tan 105^\circ$**.

---

#### 2. Identify the Relationship
The angle $105^\circ$ is exactly half of $210^\circ$ ($210^\circ / 2 = 105^\circ$). Since $210^\circ$ is a special angle on the unit circle, we can use the **Tangent Half-Angle Identity**.



#### 3. Choose the Identity and Determine the Sign
* **Identity Choice:** $\tan \frac{A}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos A}{\sin A}$
* **Quadrant Check:** $105^\circ$ is in **Quadrant II**. In QII, tangent values must be **negative**.

#### 4. Substitute and Solve
Set $A = 210^\circ$:
$$\tan 105^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 210^\circ}{\sin 210^\circ}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the exact values for $210^\circ$**
From the unit circle:
* $\cos 210^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\sin 210^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}$

$$\tan 105^\circ = \frac{1 - (-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})}{-\frac{1}{2}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator**
$$\tan 105^\circ = \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}}$$

**Step 3: Final Simplification**
Multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:
$$\tan 105^\circ = \left( \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \cdot \left( -2 \right)$$
$$\tan 105^\circ = -2 - \sqrt{3}$$

---

#### Final Result
**$\tan 105^\circ = -2 - \sqrt{3}$**

### Finding Half-Angle Values from Quadrant Constraints

**Problem:** Given the following trigonometric value and interval, find the exact values of $\sin \frac{\theta}{2}$, $\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$, and $\tan \frac{\theta}{2}$.
* $\sin \theta = \frac{4}{5}$
* $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$ (Quadrant II)

---

#### 1. Find $\cos \theta$ and Determine the Half-Angle Quadrant
To use the half-angle identities, we first need $\cos \theta$. Since $\theta$ is in **Quadrant II**, cosine must be negative.
$$\cos \theta = -\sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = -\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = -\sqrt{\frac{9}{25}} = -\frac{3}{3}$$

**Determine the quadrant of $\frac{\theta}{2}$:**
Divide the given interval by 2:
$$\frac{90^\circ}{2} < \frac{\theta}{2} < \frac{180^\circ}{2} \implies 45^\circ < \frac{\theta}{2} < 90^\circ$$
This places $\frac{\theta}{2}$ in **Quadrant I**, where all trigonometric functions are **positive**.

---

#### 2. Calculate $\sin \frac{\theta}{2}$
Using the identity $\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}$:
$$\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - (-3/5)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{8/5}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5}}$$
$$\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$$

#### 3. Calculate $\cos \frac{\theta}{2}$
Using the identity $\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}$:
$$\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + (-3/5)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2/5}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{5}}$$
$$\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$$

#### 4. Calculate $\tan \frac{\theta}{2}$
Using the ratio $\frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\cos(\theta/2)}$:
$$\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}/5}{\sqrt{5}/5} = 2$$


---

#### Final Results
* **$\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}$**
* **$\tan \frac{\theta}{2} = 2$**
### Verifying the Relationship between Sine and Half-Angles

**Problem:** Verify the following trigonometric identity:
$$1 + \sin \beta = (\sin \beta/2 + \cos \beta/2)^2$$

---

#### Step-by-Step Verification

To verify this identity, it is often easiest to expand the right side of the equation to see if it simplifies to match the left side.

**1. Expand the Binomial Square**
Use the algebraic expansion rule $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$:
$$(\sin \beta/2 + \cos \beta/2)^2 = \sin^2 \beta/2 + 2 \sin \beta/2 \cos \beta/2 + \cos^2 \beta/2$$

**2. Group the Squared Terms**
Rearrange the terms to group the sine and cosine squared terms together:
$$(\sin^2 \beta/2 + \cos^2 \beta/2) + 2 \sin \beta/2 \cos \beta/2$$

**3. Apply the Pythagorean Identity**
Recall that for any angle $x$, $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$. Here, our angle is $\beta/2$:
$$(1) + 2 \sin \beta/2 \cos \beta/2$$

**4. Apply the Sine Double-Angle Identity**
From your core identities, we know that $\sin 2A = 2 \sin A \cos A$. 
If we let $A = \beta/2$, then $2A = \beta$. This means:
$$2 \sin \beta/2 \cos \beta/2 = \sin \beta$$


**5. Substitute back into the expression**
$$1 + \sin \beta$$

---

#### Final Result
The right side simplifies exactly to the left side:
$$1 + \sin \beta = 1 + \sin \beta$$
**The identity is verified.**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=9h43m25s
- In a one-to-one function, each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value
- In a one-to-one function, each y-value corresponds to exactly one x-value
- **Horizontal Line Test** : Used to test for a function (each x should only have one y)
- $f^{-1}$ : If a function f is a one-to-one function, then the inverse of f is denoted as this
- To find $f^{-1}$(x) from f(x): Replace f(x) with y - Swap x and y - Solve for y - Replace y with $f^{-1}$(x)
- The domain of f will become the range of $f^{-1}$
- The range of f will become the domain of $f^{-1}$
- This tells us if (a, b) is on the graph of f, then (b, a) is on the graph of $f^{-1}$
- The graphs of f and $f^{-1}$ are reflections across the line Y=X (diagonal line going through origin)
- **Restricted Sine Function** : A Sine function with a restricted domain - you take only a part of it so it passes the *horizontal line test*
### Restricted Trigonometric Functions

Standard trigonometric functions are periodic and fail the horizontal line test over their natural domains. To create inverse functions, we must use "restricted" versions of the original functions that are one-to-one.

---

#### 1. Core Functions with Restricted Domains
The restricted domain is the specific section of the graph chosen so that every $y$-value is reached exactly once.

| Function | Equation | Restricted Domain (Input Angle) | Range (Output Ratio) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Restricted Sine** | $y = \sin(x)$ | $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ | $[-1, 1]$ |
| **Restricted Cosine** | $y = \cos(x)$ | $[0, \pi]$ | $[-1, 1]$ |
| **Restricted Tangent**| $y = \tan(x)$ | $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ | $(-\infty, \infty)$ |

---

#### 2. Derivations (Basic Calculus)
While the inverse functions use implicit differentiation, the normal functions follow standard differentiation rules.

**Example: Deriving the derivative of $\sin(x)$ using the limit definition**
1. Let $f(x) = \sin(x)$.
2. Use the definition: $f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}$
3. Apply the sum identity: $\sin(x+h) = \sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h)$
4. Through limit properties:
   $$\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)$$
--- 

#### 3. Worked Example: Evaluating within Restricted Sections
**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\sin(x)$ when $x = \frac{3\pi}{4}$, and explain why this $x$ value is typically excluded from the restricted domain used for inverses.

**Step 1: Evaluate the function**
Using the unit circle:
$$\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

**Step 2: Analyze the restriction**
While the calculation is possible, $x = \frac{3\pi}{4}$ (135°) is outside the restricted domain for Sine $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. 
* **Reason:** In the interval $[0, \pi]$, the sine function hits the value $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ twice (at $\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{4}$), failing the horizontal line test. We restrict the domain to the right-side quadrants to ensure a unique mapping.

---

#### 4. Key Identities to Remember
* **Pythagorean Identities:**
    * $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$
    * $1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)$
* **Even/Odd Properties:**
    * $\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)$ (Odd)
    * $\cos(-x) = \cos(x)$ (Even)
* **Periodic Nature:**
    * $\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)$
    * $\tan(x + \pi) = \tan(x)$
### Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Inverse trigonometric functions (arcfunctions) are used to determine the measure of an angle when the value of a trigonometric ratio is known.

---

#### 1. Core Functions, Domains, and Ranges
Because trigonometric functions are periodic, they are not one-to-one. To define their inverses, we must restrict their domains to specific intervals.

| Function | Notation | Domain (Input) | Range (Output Angle) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arcsine** | $\arcsin(x)$ or $\sin^{-1}(x)$ | $[-1, 1]$ | $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ |
| **Arccosine** | $\arccos(x)$ or $\cos^{-1}(x)$ | $[-1, 1]$ | $[0, \pi]$ |
| **Arctangent** | $\arctan(x)$ or $\tan^{-1}(x)$ | $(-\infty, \infty)$ | $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ |

---

#### 2. Derivations (Calculus of Inverse Trig)
In engineering, finding the rate of change of an angle is common. We derive the derivatives of inverse trig functions using **implicit differentiation**.

**Example: Deriving the derivative of $\arcsin(x)$**
1. Let $y = \arcsin(x)$. This can be rewritten as:
   $$\sin(y) = x$$
2. Differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:
   $$\cos(y) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 1$$
3. Isolate the derivative:
   $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\cos(y)}$$
4. Use the Pythagorean identity $\cos(y) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(y)}$. Since we know $\sin(y) = x$:
   $$\frac{d}{dx}[\arcsin(x)] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$$
--- 

#### 3. Worked Example: Composition of Functions
**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\cos(\arcsin(-\frac{1}{2}))$.

**Step 1: Evaluate the inner function**
Find the angle $\theta$ where $\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{2}$ within the restricted range $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
$$\theta = -\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ (or } -30^\circ)$$

**Step 2: Evaluate the outer function**
Now find the cosine of that angle:
$$\cos(-\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

---

#### 4. Key Identities to Remember
* **Reciprocal Relationship:** $\csc^{-1}(x) = \sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{x})$
* **Negative Arguments:**
    * $\arcsin(-x) = -\arcsin(x)$ (Odd)
    * $\arccos(-x) = \pi - \arccos(x)$
* **Cofunction Identities:** $\arcsin(x) + \arccos(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}$
### Solving Basic Inverse Trigonometric Equations

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve an inverse sine function, we are looking for the angle $y$ that produces a specific sine value.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ is equivalent to:
$$\sin y = \frac{1}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
Recall that for the inverse sine function, the output angle $y$ must fall within the restricted range:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad -90^\circ \leq y \leq 90^\circ$$

**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We need to find the angle in **Quadrant I** or **Quadrant IV** where the $y$-coordinate (sine) is $\frac{1}{2}$. 


* In the standard unit circle, $\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.
* In radians, this corresponds to $\frac{\pi}{6}$.

---

#### Final Result
The value falls within our required range $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
$$y = \frac{\pi}{6} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 30^\circ$$
### Solving Inverse Trigonometric Equations with Negative Inputs

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \sin^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

Solving an inverse sine function with a negative input requires careful attention to the restricted range of the function.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \sin^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ is equivalent to:
$$\sin y = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
The output for $y = \sin^{-1}(x)$ must fall within:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad -90^\circ \leq y \leq 90^\circ$$

**3. Reference the Unit Circle and Symmetry**
We need an angle where the $y$-coordinate is $-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* We know that $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ in **Quadrant I**.
* Since the input is negative and we are restricted to the right half of the circle, we must look in **Quadrant IV**.


**4. Determine the Angle**
In the restricted range, we move clockwise from $0^\circ$ for negative values:
* The angle is $-45^\circ$.
* In radians, this is $-\frac{\pi}{4}$.

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.
$$y = -\frac{\pi}{4} \quad \text{or} \quad y = -45^\circ$$
### Understanding Inverse Property Conditions

**Problem:** Explain the property $\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x$ and why it is restricted to the domain $-1 \leq x \leq 1$.

---

#### 1. The Inverse Property
The expression $\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = x$ states that if you take the inverse sine of a value $x$ to find an angle, and then take the sine of that resulting angle, you return to your original value $x$. The two functions "cancel" each other out.

#### 2. Why the Restriction $-1 \leq x \leq 1$?
This restriction exists because the **inner function**, $\sin^{-1}(x)$, has a specific domain. 

* **The Logic:** In the standard sine function $y = \sin(\theta)$, the output $y$ (the ratio) can never be greater than $1$ or less than $-1$ because the opposite side of a triangle cannot be longer than the hypotenuse.
* **The Constraint:** Since $\sin^{-1}(x)$ is asking "What angle gives me the value $x$?", the value $x$ must be a valid sine ratio. If you try to input $x = 2$, the function will fail because there is no angle in existence that has a sine value of $2$.


---

#### 3. Worked Example: Valid vs. Invalid
**Case A: Within Domain**
Solve: $\sin(\sin^{-1}(0.5))$
1. $\sin^{-1}(0.5) = 30^\circ$
2. $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$
3. **Result:** $0.5 = 0.5$ (The property holds)

**Case B: Outside Domain**
Solve: $\sin(\sin^{-1}(1.5))$
1. $\sin^{-1}(1.5)$ is **undefined**.
2. **Result:** No solution exists. Even though the formula looks like it should "cancel" to $1.5$, the math breaks at the first step.

---

#### 4. Summary for Engineering
In engineering applications (like signal processing or mechanics), always check that your ratios are "normalized" between $-1$ and $1$ before applying inverse functions, or your calculations will result in an error.
### Inverse Property: Angle Cancellation Restrictions

**Problem:** Explain the property $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ and why it is restricted to the interval $-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$.

---

#### 1. The Inverse Property
The expression $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ suggests that if you take the sine of an angle $x$ and then apply the inverse sine to that result, you should return to the original angle $x$. 

#### 2. The Range Restriction: Why $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$?
Unlike the previous property ($\sin(\sin^{-1}x)$), where the restriction was based on valid ratios, this restriction is based on the **definition of the Arcsine function**.

* **The Periodic Problem:** The sine function is periodic, meaning many different angles produce the same sine value (e.g., $\sin(30^\circ)$ and $\sin(150^\circ)$ both equal $0.5$).
* **The Function Rule:** A mathematical function can only have **one** output for any given input. To make $\sin^{-1}$ a true function, mathematicians restricted its output (range) to the right half of the unit circle.
* **The Consequence:** If you input an angle $x$ that is outside this range into the $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x))$ expression, the "cancellation" will not give you $x$ back; it will give you the corresponding angle that *is* within the restricted range.


---

#### 3. Worked Examples

**Case A: Within the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\sin^{-1}(\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}))$
1.  Inner part: $\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 0.5$
2.  Outer part: $\sin^{-1}(0.5) = \frac{\pi}{6}$
3.  **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6}$ (The property holds)

**Case B: Outside the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\sin^{-1}(\sin(\frac{5\pi}{6}))$
1.  Inner part: $\sin(\frac{5\pi}{6}) = 0.5$
2.  Outer part: $\sin^{-1}(0.5) = \frac{\pi}{6}$
3.  **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{6} \neq \frac{5\pi}{6}$ (The "cancellation" failed because the original angle was outside the allowed range).

---

#### 4. Engineering Takeaway
When programming or calculating inverse kinematics, you cannot assume that $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x))$ always equals $x$. You must check if your angle $x$ is within the **principal branch** ($-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$); otherwise, you may need to apply a "correction" factor to find the true physical angle.
### Applying Inverse Sine Properties

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)$ using inverse trigonometric properties.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

This problem tests the composition of a function and its inverse. We use the property $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ to determine if the functions cancel out.

**1. Recall the Cancellation Property**
The property $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ is only valid if the angle $x$ falls within the principal branch (the restricted range) of the arcsine function:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$$

**2. Check the Given Angle**
The angle in the problem is $x = -\frac{\pi}{3}$.
* We know that $-\frac{\pi}{2} \approx -1.57$ and $\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57$.
* Since $-\frac{\pi}{3} \approx -1.047$, the angle **is within** the required interval $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.

**3. Direct Evaluation (Verification)**
Because the angle is within the valid range, the functions simply cancel each other out. We can verify this step-by-step:
* **Inner Function:** $\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* **Outer Function:** $\sin^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{3}$

---

#### Final Result
Since the input angle $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ is in the restricted range of the inverse sine function, the property holds true:
$$\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) = -\frac{\pi}{3}$$
### Inverse Sine Property: Handling Angles Outside the Principal Range

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

This problem requires checking if the cancellation property $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ applies or if the angle must be adjusted.

**1. Check the Principal Range**
The property $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x)) = x$ only works if $x$ is within the principal branch (range) of arcsine:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$$

**2. Evaluate the Input Angle**
The angle given is $x = \frac{5\pi}{6}$.
* Since $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ is greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (which is $\frac{3\pi}{6}$), the angle is **outside** the principal range. 
* It is located in **Quadrant II**.


**3. Find the Equivalent Value**
Because the angle is outside the range, we must evaluate it manually:
* **Inner Function:** Find the sine of $\frac{5\pi}{6}$.
  $$\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$
* **Outer Function:** Find the inverse sine of that result within the restricted range $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
  $$\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

**4. Why isn't the answer $\frac{5\pi}{6}$?**
The inverse sine function is programmed to always give the "shortest" path to a sine value from the origin within the right half of the circle. While $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$ both have a sine of $0.5$, only $\frac{\pi}{6}$ is a valid output for the function.

---

#### Final Result
**$\sin^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$**
### Solving Inverse Cosine Equations with Negative Inputs

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve an inverse cosine function, we need to find the angle $y$ within a specific range that results in the given value.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ is equivalent to:
$$\cos y = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
Unlike the inverse sine function, the output for $y = \cos^{-1}(x)$ must fall within **Quadrant I or II**:
$$0 \leq y \leq \pi \quad \text{or} \quad 0^\circ \leq y \leq 180^\circ$$

**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We need an angle where the $x$-coordinate (cosine) is $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* We know that in Quadrant I, $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* Since our value is **negative**, we must find the corresponding angle in **Quadrant II**.

 and the point (-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2) at 150 degrees]

**4. Determine the Angle**
Using the reference angle of $30^\circ$ in Quadrant II:
* $y = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ$
* In radians: $y = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $[0, \pi]$.
**$y = \frac{5\pi}{6} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 150^\circ$**
### Solving Inverse Cosine Equations with Negative Radicals

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse cosine function, we must find an angle $y$ within the function's restricted range that satisfies the given cosine value.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ can be rewritten as:
$$\cos y = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
For the inverse cosine function, the output angle $y$ must fall within the range:
$$0 \leq y \leq \pi \quad \text{or} \quad 0^\circ \leq y \leq 180^\circ$$
This means our answer must be in **Quadrant I** or **Quadrant II**.

**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We need to find an angle where the $x$-coordinate (cosine) is $-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* In **Quadrant I**, $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* Since our target value is **negative**, we look for the corresponding angle in **Quadrant II**.

**4. Determine the Angle**
Using the reference angle of $45^\circ$ ($\frac{\pi}{4}$) in Quadrant II:
* In degrees: $y = 180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ$.
* In radians: $y = \pi - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $[0, \pi]$.
**$y = \frac{3\pi}{4} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 135^\circ$**
### Inverse Cosine Identity: Ratio Cancellation

**Problem:** Explain the property $\cos(\cos^{-1}(x)) = x$ and the conditions under which it is valid.

---

#### 1. The Identity Explained
The property $\cos(\cos^{-1}(x)) = x$ states that taking the inverse cosine of a value $x$ (to find an angle) and then taking the cosine of that resulting angle will return you to the original value $x$. The two functions effectively "undo" each other.

#### 2. The Domain Restriction: $-1 \leq x \leq 1$
This identity only works if the input $x$ is a valid ratio that a cosine function can actually produce.

* **The Geometry:** In a right triangle, cosine is defined as $\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Since the hypotenuse is always the longest side, this ratio can never be greater than $1$ or less than $-1$.
* **The Function Constraint:** The domain of the inner function, $\cos^{-1}(x)$, is restricted to $[-1, 1]$. If you provide an $x$ outside of this range, the inner function becomes **undefined**, and the entire expression fails.


---

#### 3. Worked Examples

**Case A: Valid Input**
Solve: $\cos(\cos^{-1}(0.8))$
1. $\cos^{-1}(0.8) \approx 36.87^\circ$
2. $\cos(36.87^\circ) = 0.8$
3. **Result:** $0.8$ (The identity holds because $0.8$ is between $-1$ and $1$).

**Case B: Invalid Input**
Solve: $\cos(\cos^{-1}(2.5))$
1. The value $2.5$ is outside the interval $[-1, 1]$.
2. $\cos^{-1}(2.5)$ has no real solution.
3. **Result:** **Undefined**. You cannot "cancel" the functions here because the first step is mathematically impossible.
### Inverse Cosine Identity: Angle Cancellation Restrictions

**Problem:** Explain the property $\cos^{-1}(\cos(x)) = x$ and why it is restricted to the interval $0 \leq x \leq \pi$.

---

#### 1. The Inverse Property
The expression $\cos^{-1}(\cos(x)) = x$ suggests that if you take the cosine of an angle $x$ and then apply the inverse cosine to that result, you should return to the original angle $x$.

#### 2. The Range Restriction: Why $0$ to $\pi$?
Because the cosine function is periodic, different angles can produce the same cosine value (e.g., $\cos(60^\circ)$ and $\cos(-60^\circ)$ both equal $0.5$). To ensure that the inverse cosine ($\cos^{-1}$) is a mathematical function with only one output for every input, its range is restricted to the upper half of the unit circle.

* **The Rule:** The output of $\cos^{-1}(x)$ must always be between $0$ and $\pi$ (or $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$).
* **The Consequence:** If your original angle $x$ is outside this interval, the functions will not simply cancel out. Instead, the expression will evaluate to the unique angle within the $[0, \pi]$ range that shares the same cosine value.


---

#### 3. Worked Examples

**Case A: Within the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\cos^{-1}(\cos(\frac{\pi}{3}))$
1.  Inner part: $\cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 0.5$
2.  Outer part: $\cos^{-1}(0.5) = \frac{\pi}{3}$
3.  **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\pi}{3}$ (The property holds because $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is between $0$ and $\pi$).

**Case B: Outside the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\cos^{-1}(\cos(-\frac{\pi}{3}))$
1.  Inner part: $\cos(-\frac{\pi}{3}) = 0.5$
2.  Outer part: $\cos^{-1}(0.5) = \frac{\pi}{3}$
3.  **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{3} \neq -\frac{\pi}{3}$ (The "cancellation" failed because the original angle was negative, placing it outside the $[0, \pi]$ range).
### Inverse Cosine Identity: Adjusting Angles Outside the Principal Range

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\cos^{-1}\left(\cos\left(\frac{7\pi}{4}\right)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this composition of functions, we must determine if the angle $x = \frac{7\pi}{4}$ allows for direct cancellation using the property $\cos^{-1}(\cos(x)) = x$.

**1. Check the Principal Range**
The cancellation property $\cos^{-1}(\cos(x)) = x$ is only valid if the angle $x$ is within the principal branch (range) of the arccosine function:
$$0 \leq x \leq \pi$$

**2. Evaluate the Input Angle**
The angle given is $x = \frac{7\pi}{4}$.
* We know that $\pi = \frac{4\pi}{4}$.
* Since $\frac{7\pi}{4}$ is greater than $\pi$, the angle is **outside** the principal range. It is located in **Quadrant IV**.

**3. Find the Equivalent Value**
Because the property does not apply directly, we evaluate the expression manually:
* **Inner Function:** Find the cosine of $\frac{7\pi}{4}$. This angle has a reference angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in Quadrant IV, where cosine is positive.
  $$\cos\left(\frac{7\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$
* **Outer Function:** Find the inverse cosine of that result within the restricted range $[0, \pi]$.
  $$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

**4. Why isn't the answer $\frac{7\pi}{4}$?**
The arccosine function is restricted to outputting angles in the upper half of the unit circle (Quadrants I and II). While both $\frac{7\pi}{4}$ and $\frac{\pi}{4}$ have a cosine value of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, only $\frac{\pi}{4}$ is a valid output for the function.

---

#### Final Result
**$\cos^{-1}\left(\cos\left(\frac{7\pi}{4}\right)\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}$**
### Solving Inverse Tangent Equations

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3})$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse tangent function, we look for an angle $y$ within the function's restricted range that produces the given ratio.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3})$ is equivalent to:
$$\tan y = \sqrt{3}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
For the inverse tangent function, the output angle $y$ must fall within the open interval:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} < y < \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad -90^\circ < y < 90^\circ$$
Since $\sqrt{3}$ is positive, our answer must be in **Quadrant I**.


**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
Recall that $\tan y = \frac{\sin y}{\cos y}$. We need a point on the unit circle where the $y$-coordinate divided by the $x$-coordinate equals $\sqrt{3}$.
* At $60^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{3}$), the coordinates are $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$.
* Calculation: $\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}$.

**4. Determine the Angle**
The angle that satisfies both the value and the range restriction is:
* In degrees: $y = 60^\circ$
* In radians: $y = \frac{\pi}{3}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
**$y = \frac{\pi}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 60^\circ$**
### Solving Inverse Tangent Equations with Negative Inputs

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse tangent function, we need to find the angle $y$ within the restricted range that produces the given ratio.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$ is equivalent to:
$$\tan y = -\sqrt{3}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
Recall that for the inverse tangent function, the output angle $y$ must fall within the open interval:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} < y < \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad -90^\circ < y < 90^\circ$$
Since the input $-\sqrt{3}$ is negative, our answer must be in **Quadrant IV**.

**3. Reference the Unit Circle and Symmetry**
We need a point on the unit circle where $\frac{\sin y}{\cos y} = -\sqrt{3}$.
* We know that in Quadrant I, $\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}$.
* Because of the odd function property ($\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\tan^{-1}(x)$), we look for the negative counterpart in the restricted range.

**4. Determine the Angle**
Moving clockwise from $0^\circ$ into Quadrant IV:
* In degrees: $y = -60^\circ$
* In radians: $y = -\frac{\pi}{3}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
**$y = -\frac{\pi}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad y = -60^\circ$**
### Inverse Tangent Identity: Ratio Cancellation

**Problem:** Explain the property $\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$ and the conditions under which it is valid.

---

#### 1. The Identity Explained
The property $\tan(\tan^{-1}(x)) = x$ indicates that if you take the inverse tangent of a value $x$ to find an angle, and then take the tangent of that resulting angle, you return exactly to the original value $x$.

#### 2. Domain: $x \in \mathbb{R}$
Unlike Arcsine and Arccosine, which are restricted to inputs between $-1$ and $1$, the inverse tangent function accepts **any real number**.

* **The Geometry:** In a right triangle, tangent is $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. As the angle approaches $90^\circ$, the opposite side can become infinitely larger than the adjacent side.
* **The Function Constraint:** Because the range of the standard tangent function is $(-\infty, \infty)$, the domain of its inverse is likewise all real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$). 


---

#### 3. Worked Examples

**Case A: Standard Value**
Solve: $\tan(\tan^{-1}(1))$
1. $\tan^{-1}(1) = 45^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{4}$)
2. $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$
3. **Result:** $1 = 1$

**Case B: Large Value**
Solve: $\tan(\tan^{-1}(1000))$
1. $\tan^{-1}(1000) \approx 89.94^\circ$
2. $\tan(89.94^\circ) \approx 1000$
3. **Result:** $1000 = 1000$ (The identity holds for any value, no matter how large).

#### 4. Summary Table for Composition Identities

| Identity               | Condition for $x$  | Reason                      |
| :--------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------- |
| $\sin(\sin^{-1}x) = x$ | $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ | Ratio limited by hypotenuse |
| $\cos(\cos^{-1}x) = x$ | $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ | Ratio limited by hypotenuse |
| $\tan(\tan^{-1}x) = x$ | $x \in \mathbb{R}$ | Ratio can be any value      |
### Inverse Tangent Identity: Angle Cancellation Restrictions

**Problem:** Explain the property $\tan^{-1}(\tan(x)) = x$ and why it is restricted to the interval $-\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \frac{\pi}{2}$.

---

#### 1. The Inverse Property
The identity $\tan^{-1}(\tan(x)) = x$ states that applying the tangent function to an angle and then the inverse tangent to the result returns the original angle. This only works seamlessly when the angle $x$ falls within the specific range where the tangent function is "one-to-one."

#### 2. The Range Restriction: Why $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$?
Because tangent is periodic (repeating every $\pi$ radians), infinitely many angles can produce the same tangent value. To make the inverse a true function with a single output, we restrict the range to the central branch of the tangent graph.

* **Vertical Asymptotes:** At $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $x = -\frac{\pi}{2}$, the tangent function is undefined (division by zero). Therefore, the range of the inverse tangent uses **strict inequalities** and does not include the endpoints.
* **The Rule:** The output of $\tan^{-1}(x)$ must always be strictly between $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

---

#### 3. Worked Examples

**Case A: Within the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\tan^{-1}(\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}))$
1.  Inner part: $\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 1$
2.  Outer part: $\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}$
3.  **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$ (The identity holds because $45^\circ$ is within the valid range).

**Case B: Outside the Restricted Range**
Solve: $\tan^{-1}(\tan(\frac{3\pi}{4}))$
1.  Inner part: $\tan(\frac{3\pi}{4}) = -1$ (Quadrant II)
2.  Outer part: $\tan^{-1}(-1) = -\frac{\pi}{4}$
3.  **Result:** $-\frac{\pi}{4} \neq \frac{3\pi}{4}$ (The identity failed because the original angle was outside the $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ interval).

### Inverse Tangent Identity: Evaluating Angles Outside the Restricted Range

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\tan^{-1}\left(\tan\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this composition, we must check if the angle $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$ allows for direct cancellation using the identity $\tan^{-1}(\tan(x)) = x$.

**1. Check the Restricted Range**
The cancellation identity $\tan^{-1}(\tan(x)) = x$ is only valid if the angle $x$ falls within the principal branch of the tangent function:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \frac{\pi}{2}$$

**2. Evaluate the Input Angle**
The angle given is $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$.
* We know that $\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{1.5\pi}{3}$.
* Since $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ is much larger than $\frac{1.5\pi}{3}$, the angle is **outside** the restricted range. It is located in **Quadrant III**.

**3. Find the Equivalent Value**
Because the angle is outside the required range, we evaluate the expression in two steps:
* **Inner Function:** Find the tangent of $\frac{4\pi}{3}$. Since it is in Quadrant III, the tangent is positive and uses the reference angle $\frac{\pi}{3}$.
  $$\tan\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}$$
* **Outer Function:** Find the inverse tangent of that result within the restricted range $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
  $$\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3}$$

**4. Why isn't the answer $\frac{4\pi}{3}$?**
The inverse tangent function is defined to only return values from the right half of the unit circle (Quadrants I and IV). Although $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{\pi}{3}$ share the same tangent value ($\sqrt{3}$), only $\frac{\pi}{3}$ lies within the function's official output range.

---

#### Final Result
**$\tan^{-1}\left(\tan\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}$**
### Solving Inverse Cotangent Equations

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \cot^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse cotangent function, we must find an angle $y$ within the standard restricted range that produces the given ratio.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \cot^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$ is equivalent to:
$$\cot y = -\sqrt{3}$$
Since $\cot y = \frac{\cos y}{\sin y}$ or $\frac{1}{\tan y}$, this can also be viewed as:
$$\tan y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
The standard principal range for the inverse cotangent function is:
$$0 < y < \pi \quad \text{or} \quad 0^\circ < y < 180^\circ$$

Because the input value ($-\sqrt{3}$) is **negative**, the angle must fall in **Quadrant II**.

**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We look for an angle where the $x$-coordinate divided by the $y$-coordinate ($\frac{\cos y}{\sin y}$) equals $-\sqrt{3}$.
* In **Quadrant I**, $\cot(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}$. This gives us a reference angle of $30^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{6}$).
* In **Quadrant II**, we use that reference angle: $180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ$.

**4. Determine the Angle**
* In degrees: $y = 150^\circ$
* In radians: $y = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $(0, \pi)$.
**$y = \frac{5\pi}{6} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 150^\circ$**
### Solving Inverse Secant Equations

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \sec^{-1}(\sqrt{2})$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse secant function, we need to find an angle $y$ within the principal range that yields the given ratio.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \sec^{-1}(\sqrt{2})$ is equivalent to:
$$\sec(y) = \sqrt{2}$$
Since $\sec(y) = \frac{1}{\cos(y)}$, we can rewrite this in terms of cosine for easier evaluation:
$$\cos(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
The principal range for the inverse secant function (based on the restricted cosine domain) is:
$$[0, \pi], y \neq \frac{\pi}{2}$$
Since $\sqrt{2}$ is positive, the angle must be in **Quadrant I**.


**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We need to find an angle in Quadrant I where the cosine (the $x$-coordinate) is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* From the unit circle, we know that $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
* Therefore, $\sec(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos(45^\circ)} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}$.

**4. Determine the Angle**
* In degrees: $y = 45^\circ$
* In radians: $y = \frac{\pi}{4}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $[0, \pi]$.
**$y = \frac{\pi}{4} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 45^\circ$**
### Solving Inverse Cosecant Equations with Rationalized Radicals

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $y = \csc^{-1}\left(-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this inverse cosecant function, we search for an angle $y$ within the principal range that produces the given ratio.

**1. Rewrite the Equation**
The expression $y = \csc^{-1}\left(-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)$ is equivalent to:
$$\csc(y) = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$$
Since $\csc(y) = \frac{1}{\sin(y)}$, we can invert the fraction to find the sine value:
$$\sin(y) = -\frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
Rationalizing the denominator (multiplying by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$):
$$\sin(y) = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2 \cdot 3} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

**2. Observe the Restricted Range**
The principal range for the inverse cosecant function (derived from the restricted sine domain) is:
$$[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}], y \neq 0$$
Since the value $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is **negative**, the angle must fall in **Quadrant IV** as a negative rotation.

**3. Reference the Unit Circle**
We need to find an angle where the $y$-coordinate (sine) is $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* In **Quadrant I**, $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* In the restricted range for **Quadrant IV**, we use the negative version of that reference angle.

**4. Determine the Angle**
* In degrees: $y = -60^\circ$
* In radians: $y = -\frac{\pi}{3}$

---

#### Final Result
The value fits within the required interval $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
**$y = -\frac{\pi}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad y = -60^\circ$**
### Solving Composition of Trigonometric Functions

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\sin^{-1}\left(\tan\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this composition, we evaluate the expression from the inside out, starting with the inner trigonometric function.

**1. Evaluate the Inner Function**
First, find the value of $\tan\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$.
* The angle $-\frac{\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant IV**.
* In Quadrant IV, tangent is negative.
* Since $\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1$, then:
  $$\tan\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = -1$$

**2. Substitute the Value into the Outer Function**
Now, substitute $-1$ back into the inverse sine function:
$$y = \sin^{-1}(-1)$$

**3. Observe the Restricted Range**
For the inverse sine function, the output angle $y$ must fall within the range:
$$-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad -90^\circ \leq y \leq 90^\circ$$

**4. Determine the Angle**
We need to find an angle where the $y$-coordinate (sine) on the unit circle is $-1$.
* On the unit circle, $\sin(y) = -1$ occurs at the bottom of the circle ($270^\circ$).
* However, we must provide the answer within the restricted range $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$.
* The equivalent angle is $-\frac{\pi}{2}$.

---

#### Final Result
**$\sin^{-1}\left(\tan\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\right) = -\frac{\pi}{2}$**
### Solving Trigonometric Compositions with Right Triangles

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\tan\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

When the inner value is not a "special value" from the unit circle, we use a right triangle sketch to find the exact ratio.

**1. Define the Angle**
Let $\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$. This implies:
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{4}$$
Since the ratio is positive, $\theta$ must be in **Quadrant I**.

**2. Sketch a Right Triangle**
Recall that $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$.
* **Opposite side ($y$):** $3$
* **Hypotenuse ($r$):** $4$


**3. Find the Adjacent Side ($x$)**
Use the Pythagorean theorem: $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$
$$x^2 + 3^2 = 4^2$$
$$x^2 + 9 = 16$$
$$x^2 = 7 \implies x = \sqrt{7}$$

**4. Evaluate the Outer Function**
Now, find the tangent of the angle $\theta$ using the sides we just found:
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}}$$

**5. Rationalize the Denominator**
Multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{7}$:
$$\frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{7}$$

---

#### Final Result
**$\tan\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\right) = \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{7}$**
### Solving Complex Trigonometric Compositions with Sum Identities

**Problem:** Find the exact value of $\sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \tan^{-1}(-3)\right)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

To solve this, we recognize it is in the form $\sin(\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\beta = \tan^{-1}(-3)$. We must use the sine sum identity:
$$\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin\alpha \cos\beta + \cos\alpha \sin\beta$$

**1. Define and Evaluate Angle $\alpha$**
Let $\alpha = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$.
* Since $\frac{1}{2}$ is a special value, we know $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\circ$).
* **$\sin\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$**
* **$\cos\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$**

**2. Define and Evaluate Angle $\beta$**
Let $\beta = \tan^{-1}(-3)$. This is not a special value, so we use a reference triangle.
* Since the tangent ratio is negative, $\beta$ must be in **Quadrant IV** (the restricted range for $\tan^{-1}$ is $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$).
* $\tan\beta = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}} = \frac{-3}{1}$.
* Find the hypotenuse ($r$): $r = \sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{10}$.
* **$\sin\beta = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10}$**
* **$\cos\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}$**


**3. Apply the Sum Identity**
Substitute the values into the identity:
$$\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{3\sqrt{10}}{10}\right)$$

**4. Simplify the Expression**
$$\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{20} - \frac{3\sqrt{30}}{20}$$
Combine the numerators:
$$\frac{\sqrt{10} - 3\sqrt{30}}{20}$$

---

#### Final Result
**$\sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \tan^{-1}(-3)\right) = \frac{\sqrt{10} - 3\sqrt{30}}{20}$**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=11h1m40s
### Solving Trigonometric Equations: Linear Methods

Linear methods are applied to trigonometric equations where the trigonometric function (e.g., $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, $\tan(x)$) appears to the first power and is not multiplied by another trigonometric function. These equations generally take the form $a \cdot f(x) + b = 0$.

---

#### General Procedure

1.  **Isolate the Trigonometric Function:** Use algebraic operations to get the function by itself on one side of the equation.
2.  **Determine the Reference Angle:** Find the acute angle $\theta'$ that satisfies the equation in the first quadrant.
3.  **Identify the Quadrants:** Based on the sign (positive or negative) of the value, identify which quadrants the solutions lie in (using ASTC/CAST rules).
4.  **Find the Particular Solutions:** Calculate the angles within the specified interval, usually $[0, 2\pi)$ or $[0, 360^\circ)$.
5.  **State the General Solution (if required):** Add the period of the function ($+ 2n\pi$ for sine/cosine, $+ n\pi$ for tangent) to account for coterminal angles.

---

#### Example: Basic Linear Equation

**Equation:** $2\cos(x) + \sqrt{3} = 0$ over $[0, 2\pi)$

1.  **Isolate:** $2\cos(x) = -\sqrt{3}$
    $\cos(x) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

2.  **Reference Angle:** $\cos^{-1}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\pi}{6}$

3.  **Quadrants:** Cosine is negative in Quadrants II and III.

4.  **Calculate Solutions:**
    * **QII:** $\pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$
    * **QIII:** $\pi + \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{7\pi}{6}$



---

#### Handling Multiple Angles

When the argument is not just $x$ (e.g., $\sin(2x)$ or $\tan(x + \theta)$), solve for the entire argument first, then isolate $x$.

* **Adjustment:** If the interval for $x$ is $[0, 2\pi)$, the interval for $2x$ becomes $[0, 4\pi)$. You must find all solutions within this expanded range before dividing by 2.

#### Key Strategies

| Scenario | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Common Factor** | If the equation is $2\sin(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x) = 0$, factor out $\sin(x)$ to create two linear equations. |
| **Different Functions** | Use identities (like $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$) to convert the equation into a single trigonometric ratio if possible. |
| **Tangent/Cotangent** | Remember that the period is $\pi$, so general solutions only need $+ n\pi$. |

### Solving $2 + 4 \sin \theta = 4$

To solve this linear trigonometric equation, we isolate the sine function and determine the angles that satisfy the equation within a standard interval, typically $[0, 2\pi)$ or $[0^\circ, 360^\circ)$.

---

#### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Isolate the Sine Term:**
   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   $4 \sin \theta = 2$
   Divide by 4:
   $\sin \theta = \frac{2}{4} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$

2. **Find the Reference Angle:**
   The angle in the first quadrant where the sine is $1/2$ is:
   $\theta' = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\circ$)

3. **Identify Quadrants:**
   Since $\sin \theta$ is positive ($+1/2$), the solutions must lie in **Quadrant I** and **Quadrant II**.

4. **Calculate Specific Solutions:**
   * **QI:** $\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}$ (or $30^\circ$)
   * **QII:** $\pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$ (or $180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ$)


---

#### Final Results

* **Primary Solutions:** $\theta = \{ \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6} \}$ or $\{ 30^\circ, 150^\circ \}$
* **General Solution:** $\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2n\pi$
  $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2n\pi$

**Problem:** Solve $-4 - 4 \cos \theta = -3 - 2 \cos \theta$ for $0^\circ \le \theta < 360^\circ$.

---

#### 1. Algebraic Isolation
Treat $\cos \theta$ as a single variable (like $x$) and group like terms:
* **Add $4 \cos \theta$ to both sides:**
    $$-4 = -3 + 2 \cos \theta$$
* **Add 3 to both sides:**
    $$-1 = 2 \cos \theta$$
* **Divide by 2 to isolate the function:**
    $$\cos \theta = -\frac{1}{2}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Reference Angle
Find the acute angle $\theta'$ where the cosine value is positive $\frac{1}{2}$:
$$\theta' = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 60^\circ$$

---

#### 3. Determine Quadrants and Final Angles
Since the value of $\cos \theta$ is **negative** ($-\frac{1}{2}$), the solutions must lie in **Quadrant II** and **Quadrant III** (where $x$-coordinates are negative).


* **Quadrant II Solution:**
    $$\theta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ$$
* **Quadrant III Solution:**
    $$\theta = 180^\circ + 60^\circ = 240^\circ$$

#### 1. Algebraic Isolation
Group all $\tan \theta$ terms on one side and constant values on the other:
* **Subtract 4 from both sides:**
  $$-3\sqrt{3} - \tan \theta = 8 \tan \theta$$
* **Add $\tan \theta$ to both sides:**
  $$-3\sqrt{3} = 9 \tan \theta$$
* **Divide by 9 to isolate the function:**
  $$\tan \theta = \frac{-3\sqrt{3}}{9}$$
* **Simplify the fraction:**
  $$\tan \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Reference Angle

### Solving Trigonometric Equations by Factoring

When a trigonometric equation contains a squared term (like $\sin^2 \theta$) or multiple trigonometric functions, factoring is often the most effective method to break the equation down into simpler linear parts.

---

#### General Procedure

1.  **Set the Equation to Zero:** Move all terms to one side so the equation takes the form $f(\theta) = 0$.
2.  **Look for Factoring Patterns:**
    * **Greatest Common Factor (GCF):** e.g., $2\sin^2 \theta - \sin \theta = 0 \implies \sin \theta(2\sin \theta - 1) = 0$.
    * **Trinomials (Quadratic Form):** e.g., $2\cos^2 \theta + \cos \theta - 1 = 0 \implies (2\cos \theta - 1)(\cos \theta + 1) = 0$.
    * **Difference of Squares:** e.g., $\sin^2 \theta - 1 = 0 \implies (\sin \theta - 1)(\sin \theta + 1) = 0$.
3.  **Zero Product Property:** Set each individual factor equal to zero.
4.  **Solve the Linear Equations:** Determine the angles for each factor using the unit circle and quadrant rules.
5.  **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** Ensure the values are within the required interval (usually $[0, 2\pi)$).

---

#### Example: Factoring a Trinomial

**Equation:** $2\sin^2 \theta - 3\sin \theta + 1 = 0$ over $[0, 360^\circ)$

1.  **Factor as a Quadratic:**
    $(2\sin \theta - 1)(\sin \theta - 1) = 0$
2.  **Set Factors to Zero:**
    * $2\sin \theta - 1 = 0 \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$
    * $\sin \theta - 1 = 0 \implies \sin \theta = 1$
3.  **Find Angles:**
    * For $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$: $\theta = 30^\circ, 150^\circ$
    * For $\sin \theta = 1$: $\theta = 90^\circ$
4.  **Final Solution Set:**
    $\theta = \{30^\circ, 90^\circ, 150^\circ\}$

#### Strategies for Complex Factoring

| Scenario | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mixed Functions** | Use Pythagorean identities (e.g., $\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta$) to ensure all terms use the same function before factoring. |
| **Four Terms** | Attempt **factoring by grouping**. For example, group the first two terms and the last two terms to find a common binomial factor. |
| **Substitution** | If the structure is confusing, replace the function with $u$ (e.g., let $u = \tan \theta$). Solve for $u$, then substitute back. |

### $3\cos \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta = -1$ (Substitution Method)

$3\cos \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta = -1$

By substituting a variable for the trigonometric function, we can treat the problem as a standard algebraic quadratic equation.

---

#### 1. Define the Substitution
Let $u = \cos \theta$.
Rewriting the equation in terms of $u$:
$$3u + 2u^2 = -1$$

#### 2. Standard Quadratic Form
Rearrange the terms to set the equation to zero:
$$2u^2 + 3u + 1 = 0$$

#### 3. Solve for $u$
We can factor the trinomial:
$$(2u + 1)(u + 1) = 0$$

Using the **Zero Product Property**:
* $2u + 1 = 0 \implies u = -\frac{1}{2}$
* $u + 1 = 0 \implies u = -1$

#### 4. Back-Substitution
Now, replace $u$ with $\cos \theta$ to solve for the angles:

**Case 1: $\cos \theta = -\frac{1}{2}$**
* **Reference Angle:** $\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}) = 60^\circ$
* **Quadrants:** Cosine is negative in Quadrants II and III.
* **QII:** $180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ$
* **QIII:** $180^\circ + 60^\circ = 240^\circ$



**Case 2: $\cos \theta = -1$**
* **Angle:** This occurs at exactly $180^\circ$ on the unit circle.

### $4 = \sin \beta + 2\sin^2 \beta + 3$

This quadratic-form trigonometric equation can be solved by rearranging the terms and factoring the trigonometric functions directly.

---

#### 1. Rearrange into Standard Quadratic Form
Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:
* Subtract 4 from both sides:
  $$0 = 2\sin^2 \beta + \sin \beta - 1$$

#### 2. Factor Directly
We factor the expression $2\sin^2 \beta + \sin \beta - 1$ similarly to how we would factor a standard trinomial ($2x^2 + x - 1$):
$$(2\sin \beta - 1)(\sin \beta + 1) = 0$$

#### 3. Apply the Zero Product Property
Set each factor equal to zero:

* **Factor 1:**
    $$2\sin \beta - 1 = 0 \implies \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2}$$
* **Factor 2:**
    $$\sin \beta + 1 = 0 \implies \sin \beta = -1$$

#### 4. Determine the Angles ($0^\circ \le \beta < 360^\circ$)

**For $\sin \beta = \frac{1}{2}$:**
* Sine is positive in **Quadrant I** and **Quadrant II**.
* Reference angle: $30^\circ$
* **QI:** $\beta = 30^\circ$
* **QII:** $180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ$



**For $\sin \beta = -1$:**
* Sine represents the $y$-coordinate on the unit circle.
* The $y$-coordinate is $-1$ only at the very bottom of the circle.
* **Angle:** $\beta = 270^\circ$

> $\beta = \{30^\circ, 150^\circ, 270^\circ\}$
### $\tan^2 \beta + \tan \beta - 2 = 0$

This equation is in quadratic form. We can solve it by factoring the trigonometric expression directly and then finding the corresponding angles on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. Factor the Quadratic Expression
We look for two numbers that multiply to $-2$ and add to $+1$. These numbers are $+2$ and $-1$.
$$(\tan \beta + 2)(\tan \beta - 1) = 0$$

#### 2. Apply the Zero Product Property
Set each factor equal to zero to solve for $\tan \beta$:

* **Factor 1:**
    $$\tan \beta + 2 = 0 \implies \tan \beta = -2$$
* **Factor 2:**
    $$\tan \beta - 1 = 0 \implies \tan \beta = 1$$

#### 3. Determine the Angles ($0^\circ \le \beta < 360^\circ$)

**Case 1: $\tan \beta = 1$**
Tangent is positive in **Quadrant I** and **Quadrant III**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\beta' = \arctan(1) = 45^\circ$
* **QI:** $\beta = 45^\circ$
* **QIII:** $180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ$


**Case 2: $\tan \beta = -2$**
Tangent is negative in **Quadrant II** and **Quadrant IV**. Since $-2$ is not a standard unit circle value, we use a calculator:
* **Reference Angle:** $\beta' = \arctan(2) \approx 63.4^\circ$
* **QII:** $180^\circ - 63.4^\circ = 116.6^\circ$
* **QIV:** $360^\circ - 63.4^\circ = 296.6^\circ$

> $\beta \approx \{45^\circ, 116.6^\circ, 225^\circ, 296.6^\circ\}$
### $\cos \beta \cot \beta = \cos \beta$

To solve this equation, we use factoring. A common mistake is to divide both sides by $\cos \beta$; however, doing so could cause us to lose potential solutions where $\cos \beta = 0$.

---

#### 1. Set the Equation to Zero
Move all terms to one side of the equals sign:
$$\cos \beta \cot \beta - \cos \beta = 0$$

#### 2. Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
Both terms contain $\cos \beta$. Factor it out:
$$\cos \beta (\cot \beta - 1) = 0$$

#### 3. Apply the Zero Product Property
Set each individual factor equal to zero:

* **Factor 1:**
    $$\cos \beta = 0$$
* **Factor 2:**
    $$\cot \beta - 1 = 0 \implies \cot \beta = 1$$

#### 4. Determine the Angles ($0^\circ \le \beta < 360^\circ$)

**Case 1: $\cos \beta = 0$**
On the unit circle, the $x$-coordinate is $0$ at the top and bottom.
* $\beta = 90^\circ$
* $\beta = 270^\circ$

**Case 2: $\cot \beta = 1$**
Since $\cot \beta = \frac{1}{\tan \beta}$, this is equivalent to $\tan \beta = 1$.
Tangent (and cotangent) is positive in **Quadrant I** and **Quadrant III**.
* **Reference Angle:** $45^\circ$
* **QI:** $\beta = 45^\circ$
* **QIII:** $180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ$


---

#### 5. Verify Domain Restrictions
The function $\cot \beta$ is undefined when $\sin \beta = 0$ (at $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$). Since none of our solutions are $0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$, all solutions are valid.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=11h44m20s
### Solving Trigonometric Equations: Square Roots, Squaring, and Identities

When trigonometric equations involve squared terms or mismatched functions, advanced algebraic techniques and identities are required to reduce them to solvable linear forms.

---

#### 1. The Square Root Method
This method is used when the equation contains a single squared trigonometric function and a constant.

* **Process:** Isolate the squared function and take the square root of both sides.
* **Crucial Step:** Always include the **plus-or-minus ($\pm$)** sign when taking the square root. This often doubles the number of solutions as it accounts for multiple quadrants.
* **Example:**
    $$\tan^2 \theta - 3 = 0$$
    $$\tan^2 \theta = 3$$
    $$\tan \theta = \pm\sqrt{3}$$
    *Solutions exist in all four quadrants where the reference angle is $60^\circ$.*



---

#### 2. Using Pythagorean Identities
If an equation contains two different trigonometric functions (e.g., $\sin^2 \theta$ and $\cos \theta$), use identities to convert the entire equation into a single function.

* **Core Identities:**
    * $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$
    * $1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta$
    * $1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$
* **Process:** Replace the squared term. For example, replace $\sin^2 \theta$ with $(1 - \cos^2 \theta)$ to create a quadratic equation entirely in terms of cosine.

---

#### 3. The Squaring Method
This is a "last resort" technique used when you have two different functions that are not squared (e.g., $\sin \theta + \cos \theta = 1$).

* **Process:**
    1.  Isolate one trigonometric function on one side.
    2.  Square both sides of the equation.
    3.  Use a Pythagorean identity to convert to a single function.
    4.  Solve the resulting equation.
* **⚠️ Warning:** Squaring both sides can introduce **extraneous solutions** (answers that satisfy the squared equation but not the original one). You **must** check every solution in the original equation.

---

#### Summary Strategy Table

| Equation Type | Recommended Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| Single squared term (e.g., $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{4}$) | **Square Root Method** (Don't forget $\pm$) |
| Mixed functions with one squared (e.g., $\sin^2 \theta + \cos \theta = 0$) | **Pythagorean Identity** substitution |
| Mixed functions, no squares (e.g., $\sec \theta + \tan \theta = 1$) | **Squaring Both Sides** (Check for extraneous solutions) |
| Multi-angle arguments (e.g., $\cos(2\theta)$) | **Double-Angle Identities** or Interval Adjustment |

### $4 \sin^2 \beta - 1 = 0$

$4 \sin^2 \beta - 1 = 0$ 

This equation can be solved using the **Square Root Method**, as it involves a single squared trigonometric function and a constant.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Squared Function
* **Add 1 to both sides:**
    $$4 \sin^2 \beta = 1$$
* **Divide by 4:**
    $$\sin^2 \beta = \frac{1}{4}$$

#### 2. Take the Square Root of Both Sides
Remember to include both the **positive and negative** roots:
$$\sin \beta = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$$
$$\sin \beta = \pm\frac{1}{2}$$

#### 3. Determine the Angles ($0^\circ \le \beta < 360^\circ$)
Since we are looking for both $\sin \beta = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\sin \beta = -\frac{1}{2}$, we will have solutions in all four quadrants.

* **Reference Angle:** $\beta' = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 30^\circ$
* **Quadrant I:** $\beta = 30^\circ$
* **Quadrant II:** $180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ$
* **Quadrant III:** $180^\circ + 30^\circ = 210^\circ$
* **Quadrant IV:** $360^\circ - 30^\circ = 330^\circ$

### $-\cos^2 \beta - 2\sin \beta = -2$

$-\cos^2 \beta - 2\sin \beta = -2$

To solve this equation, we must first use a **Pythagorean Identity** to ensure the entire equation is written in terms of a single trigonometric function (sine).

---

#### 1. Use Identity Substitution
Recall the identity $\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta$. Substitute this into the equation:
$$-(1 - \sin^2 \beta) - 2\sin \beta = -2$$

#### 2. Simplify and Set to Zero
* **Distribute the negative sign:**
  $$-1 + \sin^2 \beta - 2\sin \beta = -2$$
* **Add 2 to both sides to create a quadratic form:**
  $$\sin^2 \beta - 2\sin \beta + 1 = 0$$

#### 3. Factor the Quadratic
The expression $\sin^2 \beta - 2\sin \beta + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial:
$$(\sin \beta - 1)^2 = 0$$

#### 4. Solve for $\beta$
Take the square root of both sides:
$$\sin \beta - 1 = 0$$
$$\sin \beta = 1$$

On the unit circle, the sine (y-coordinate) is exactly $1$ at the top of the circle.
* **Angle:** $\beta = 90^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians)

### $-\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} \sin \theta$

$-\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} \sin \theta$

We can solve this equation using the identity $\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta$. This requires squaring both sides of the equation, which can introduce extraneous solutions that must be checked at the end.

---

#### 1. Square Both Sides
To generate the squared terms needed for the identity, square both sides of the equation:
$$(-\cos \theta)^2 = (\sqrt{3} \sin \theta)^2$$
$$\cos^2 \theta = 3 \sin^2 \theta$$

#### 2. Apply the Identity
Substitute $\cos^2 \theta$ with $1 - \sin^2 \theta$ to create an equation entirely in terms of sine:
$$1 - \sin^2 \theta = 3 \sin^2 \theta$$

#### 3. Solve for $\sin \theta$
* **Group the sine terms:**
  $$1 = 4 \sin^2 \theta$$
* **Divide by 4:**
  $$\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{4}$$
* **Take the square root:**
  $$\sin \theta = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \pm \frac{1}{2}$$

#### 4. Find Potential Angles ($0^\circ \le \theta < 360^\circ$)
Identify all angles where the sine is either $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$:
* **From $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$:** $\theta = 30^\circ, 150^\circ$
* **From $\sin \theta = -\frac{1}{2}$:** $\theta = 210^\circ, 330^\circ$

#### 5. Check for Extraneous Solutions
Because we squared both sides, we must test each potential solution in the **original equation** $-\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} \sin \theta$:

* **Test $30^\circ$:** $-\cos(30^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ vs $\sqrt{3} \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. **(No)**
* **Test $150^\circ$:** $-\cos(150^\circ) = -(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ vs $\sqrt{3} \sin(150^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. **(Yes)**
* **Test $210^\circ$:** $-\cos(210^\circ) = -(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ vs $\sqrt{3} \sin(210^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. **(No)**
* **Test $330^\circ$:** $-\cos(330^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ vs $\sqrt{3} \sin(330^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. **(Yes)**

### Solving Trigonometric Equations with Half-Angles

Half-angle equations involve trigonometric functions where the argument is $\frac{\theta}{2}$. These equations are typically solved by using identities to simplify the argument or by adjusting the interval of the solution set.

---

#### 1. The Half-Angle Identities
The primary goal is often to replace the half-angle term with an expression involving a single angle ($\theta$).

* **Sine:** $\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}$
* **Cosine:** $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}$
* **Tangent:** * $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}}$
    * $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
    * $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}$

---

#### 2. Strategy: Interval Adjustment
Instead of using complex radical identities, it is often easier to solve for the half-angle directly and then adjust the range.

1.  **Isolate the function:** Solve for $\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$, $\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})$, etc.
2.  **Adjust the Interval:** If the original interval for $\theta$ is $[0, 2\pi)$, then the interval for the argument $\frac{\theta}{2}$ becomes $[0, \pi)$.
3.  **Find the Half-Angle:** Find all values for $\frac{\theta}{2}$ within the adjusted interval.
4.  **Solve for $\theta$:** Multiply the resulting values by 2 to find the final solutions for $\theta$.

---

#### 3. Example Walkthrough
**Equation:** $2\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \sqrt{3} = 0$ for $[0, 2\pi)$

1.  **Isolate the function:**
    $$2\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3} \implies \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$
2.  **Adjust the Interval:** Since $0 \le \theta < 360^\circ$, we look for $\frac{\theta}{2}$ in the range $0 \le \frac{\theta}{2} < 180^\circ$.
3.  **Solve for $\frac{\theta}{2}$:**
    In the interval $[0, 180^\circ)$, $\cos(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ only at $x = 30^\circ$.
    $$\frac{\theta}{2} = 30^\circ$$
4.  **Solve for $\theta$:**
    $$\theta = 30^\circ \times 2 = 60^\circ$$

#### 4. Summary Table

| Technique | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Interval Adjustment** | When the equation is simple (one function, one constant). |
| **Identity Substitution** | When the equation contains both $\theta$ and $\frac{\theta}{2}$ terms. |

### $\sin(\beta/2) = \sqrt{2} - \sin(\beta/2)$

$\sin(\beta/2) = \sqrt{2} - \sin(\beta/2)$

This equation involves a half-angle argument. We will solve it by first isolating the trigonometric function and then adjusting the solution interval.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Sine Function
Treat $\sin(\beta/2)$ as a single variable and group the terms:
* **Add $\sin(\beta/2)$ to both sides:**
    $$2\sin(\beta/2) = \sqrt{2}$$
* **Divide by 2:**
    $$\sin(\beta/2) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

---

#### 2. Adjust the Interval
The problem specifies the interval $0 \le \beta < 2\pi$. Since the argument of our function is $\beta/2$, we must find the corresponding interval for the half-angle:
* Divide the entire interval by 2:
    $$0 \le \frac{\beta}{2} < \pi$$
We are looking for all values where the sine is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ between $0$ and $\pi$ (Quadrants I and II).

---

#### 3. Determine the Half-Angles
On the unit circle, the sine value is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ at:
* **Quadrant I:** $\frac{\beta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ (or $45^\circ$)
* **Quadrant II:** $\frac{\beta}{2} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$ (or $135^\circ$)


---

#### 4. Solve for $\beta$
Multiply each half-angle result by 2 to find the final values for $\beta$:
* **Solution 1:** $$\beta = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
* **Solution 2:** $$\beta = 2 \times \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{2}$$

### $-\cos \theta = -2 + 3 \sin(\theta/2)$ (Using Half-Angle Identity)

$-\cos \theta = -2 + 3 \sin(\theta/2)$

To solve this equation by converting the sine term into a cosine term, we use the half-angle identity for sine: $\sin(\theta/2) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}$. This method requires squaring both sides, so we must be careful to check for extraneous solutions at the end.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Half-Angle Term
First, rearrange the equation to isolate the term with the half-angle:
$$3 \sin(\theta/2) = 2 - \cos \theta$$
$$\sin(\theta/2) = \frac{2 - \cos \theta}{3}$$

#### 2. Substitute the Half-Angle Identity
Replace $\sin(\theta/2)$ with its identity:
$$\pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}} = \frac{2 - \cos \theta}{3}$$

#### 3. Square Both Sides
Squaring both sides removes the radical and the $\pm$ sign:
$$\left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 - \cos \theta}{3}\right)^2$$
$$\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2} = \frac{(2 - \cos \theta)^2}{9}$$

#### 4. Solve the Resulting Quadratic Equation
* **Cross-multiply to clear denominators:**
  $$9(1 - \cos \theta) = 2(4 - 4\cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta)$$
  $$9 - 9\cos \theta = 8 - 8\cos \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta$$

* **Rearrange into standard form ($0 = ax^2 + bx + c$):**
  $$0 = 2\cos^2 \theta + \cos \theta - 1$$

* **Factor the quadratic:**
  $$0 = (2\cos \theta - 1)(\cos \theta + 1)$$

#### 5. Find Potential Angles ($0 \le \theta < 2\pi$)
* **From $2\cos \theta - 1 = 0 \implies \cos \theta = 1/2$:**
  $\theta = 60^\circ$ ($\pi/3$) and $\theta = 300^\circ$ ($5\pi/3$)
* **From $\cos \theta + 1 = 0 \implies \cos \theta = -1$:**
  $\theta = 180^\circ$ ($\pi$)

#### 6. Verify and Check for Extraneous Solutions
Since we squared the equation, we must check these in the original: $-\cos \theta = -2 + 3 \sin(\theta/2)$.

* **Check $60^\circ$:** $-\cos(60^\circ) = -0.5$. Right side: $-2 + 3\sin(30^\circ) = -2 + 1.5 = -0.5$. **(Valid)**
* **Check $180^\circ$:** $-\cos(180^\circ) = -(-1) = 1$. Right side: $-2 + 3\sin(90^\circ) = -2 + 3 = 1$. **(Valid)**
* **Check $300^\circ$:** $-\cos(300^\circ) = -0.5$. Right side: $-2 + 3\sin(150^\circ) = -2 + 1.5 = -0.5$. **(Valid)**

### $\sqrt{3} \cos(\theta/2) = 1 + \cos \theta$

$\sqrt{3} \cos(\theta/2) = 1 + \cos \theta$

To solve this equation using your preferred method, we will substitute the half-angle identity for cosine and then solve the resulting quadratic equation.

---

#### 1. Substitute the Half-Angle Identity
Replace $\cos(\theta/2)$ with $\pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}}$:
$$\sqrt{3} \left( \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} \right) = 1 + \cos \theta$$

#### 2. Square Both Sides
Squaring both sides removes the radical and the $\pm$ sign. **Note:** This step can introduce extraneous solutions, which we will check at the end.
$$\left( \sqrt{3} \right)^2 \left( \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} \right)^2 = (1 + \cos \theta)^2$$
$$3 \left( \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2} \right) = (1 + \cos \theta)^2$$

#### 3. Simplify and Solve for $\cos \theta$
* **Clear the fraction by multiplying by 2:**
  $$3(1 + \cos \theta) = 2(1 + \cos \theta)^2$$
* **Expand the right side:**
  $$3 + 3\cos \theta = 2(1 + 2\cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta)$$
  $$3 + 3\cos \theta = 2 + 4\cos \theta + 2\cos^2 \theta$$
* **Set the equation to zero:**
  $$0 = 2\cos^2 \theta + \cos \theta - 1$$
* **Factor the quadratic:**
  $$0 = (2\cos \theta - 1)(\cos \theta + 1)$$

#### 4. Find Potential Angles ($0 \le \theta < 2\pi$)
* **Set $2\cos \theta - 1 = 0 \implies \cos \theta = 1/2$:**
  $\theta = 60^\circ$ ($\frac{\pi}{3}$) and $\theta = 300^\circ$ ($\frac{5\pi}{3}$)
* **Set $\cos \theta + 1 = 0 \implies \cos \theta = -1$:**
  $\theta = 180^\circ$ ($\pi$)

#### 5. Verify and Check for Extraneous Solutions
We must test these in the original equation: $\sqrt{3} \cos(\theta/2) = 1 + \cos \theta$.

* **Test $60^\circ$:** LHS: $\sqrt{3} \cos(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 1.5$
  RHS: $1 + \cos(60^\circ) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5$. **(Valid)**
* **Test $180^\circ$:** LHS: $\sqrt{3} \cos(90^\circ) = \sqrt{3}(0) = 0$
  RHS: $1 + \cos(180^\circ) = 1 + (-1) = 0$. **(Valid)**
* **Test $300^\circ$:** LHS: $\sqrt{3} \cos(150^\circ) = \sqrt{3}(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -1.5$
  RHS: $1 + \cos(300^\circ) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5$. **(Extraneous - Does not match)**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBT1iAqlzHY&t=12h25m50s
### Summary: Solving Trigonometric Equations with Multiple Angles

Multiple-angle equations involve trigonometric functions where the argument is a multiple of the variable (e.g., $2\theta$, $3x$, $n\beta$). These require a specific approach to ensure no solutions are missed.

---

#### 1. The Core Strategy
The primary goal is to solve for the **entire argument** first, then solve for the variable. Because the argument is multiplied, the period of the function is compressed, which usually leads to more solutions within the standard $[0, 2\pi)$ interval.

#### 2. Adjusted Interval Method
To find all solutions for $n\theta$ within the interval $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$:
* **Multiply the interval:** If $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$, then $0 \le n\theta < n \cdot 2\pi$.
* **Find all values:** Identify every angle on the unit circle that satisfies the equation within this expanded range ($n$ full rotations).
* **Divide:** Divide each resulting angle by $n$ to isolate $\theta$
#### 3. General Solution Method
Alternatively, you can find the general solution and then plug in integers for $k$:
1. Solve for the argument: $n\theta = \text{angle} + (\text{period})k$.
2. Divide the entire expression (including the period) by $n$.
3. Substitute $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ to find the specific solutions in the first rotation.

#### 4. Comparison Table

| Feature | Single Angle ($\theta$) | Multiple Angle ($2\theta$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Period of $\sin/\cos$** | $2\pi$ | $\pi$ |
| **Number of Solutions** | Typically 2 | Typically 4 |
| **Search Range** | $0$ to $2\pi$ | $0$ to $4\pi$ |

---

> [!tip] Common Mistake
> Do **not** use double-angle identities (like $\sin 2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$) unless the equation also contains single-angle terms. If the only variable is $2\theta$, the Adjusted Interval Method is much faster and less prone to error.
### $\cos 2\beta = -10\cos^2 \beta + 8$

$\cos 2\beta = -10\cos^2 \beta + 8$

To solve this equation for $\beta$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$, we will use the double-angle identity for cosine to create a single-variable quadratic equation.

---

#### 1. Apply the Identity
Substitute $\cos 2\beta$ with the identity $2\cos^2 \beta - 1$:
$$2\cos^2 \beta - 1 = -10\cos^2 \beta + 8$$

#### 2. Isolate the $\cos^2 \beta$ Term
* **Add $10\cos^2 \beta$ to both sides:**
  $$12\cos^2 \beta - 1 = 8$$
* **Add 1 to both sides:**
  $$12\cos^2 \beta = 9$$
* **Divide by 12:**
  $$\cos^2 \beta = \frac{9}{12}$$
* **Simplify the fraction:**
  $$\cos^2 \beta = \frac{3}{4}$$

#### 3. Use the Square Root Method
Take the square root of both sides, remembering to include the **plus-or-minus ($\pm$)** sign:
$$\cos \beta = \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}$$
$$\cos \beta = \pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

#### 4. Determine the Angles ($0 \le \beta < 2\pi$)
Since we have both positive and negative values, we are looking for the reference angle in all four quadrants of the unit circle.

* **Reference Angle:** $\beta' = \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 30^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{6}$)
* **Quadrant I:** $\beta = \frac{\pi}{6}$
* **Quadrant II:** $\pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$
* **Quadrant III:** $\pi + \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{7\pi}{6}$
* **Quadrant IV:** $2\pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{11\pi}{6}$

### $4 \sin \beta \cos \beta = \sqrt{3}$

$4 \sin \beta \cos \beta = \sqrt{3}$

To solve this equation for $\beta$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$, we use the double-angle identity for sine to simplify the two trigonometric functions into one.

---

#### 1. Apply the Double-Angle Identity
Recall the identity: $\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta$.
We can rewrite the left side of the equation to match this form:
$$2(2 \sin \beta \cos \beta) = \sqrt{3}$$
$$2 \sin 2\beta = \sqrt{3}$$

#### 2. Isolate the Sine Function
Divide both sides by 2:
$$\sin 2\beta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

#### 3. Adjust the Interval for the Multiple Angle
Since we are solving for $2\beta$ but the interval for $\beta$ is $[0, 2\pi)$, we must look for solutions for $2\beta$ in the expanded range:
$$0 \le 2\beta < 4\pi$$
This means we will look for solutions through **two full rotations** of the unit circle.

#### 4. Solve for $2\beta$
Sine is positive $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ in Quadrants I and II.
* **First Rotation:**
  * $2\beta = \frac{\pi}{3}$
  * $2\beta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$
* **Second Rotation (add $2\pi$ to the values above):**
  * $2\beta = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{6\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}$
  * $2\beta = \frac{2\pi}{3} + \frac{6\pi}{3} = \frac{8\pi}{3}$


#### 5. Solve for $\beta$
Divide each result by 2 to find the final values:
* $\beta = \frac{\pi}{6}$
* $\beta = \frac{\pi}{3}$
* $\beta = \frac{7\pi}{6}$
* $\beta = \frac{4\pi}{3}$

### $-9/2 = -4 + \cos(\beta + 7\pi/4)$

$-9/2 = -4 + \cos(\beta + 7\pi/4)$

This equation involves a horizontal shift within the cosine function. We will solve it by isolating the trigonometric term and then adjusting the angle based on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Cosine Function
Add 4 to both sides of the equation. Note that $4$ is equivalent to $8/2$:
$$-9/2 + 8/2 = \cos(\beta + 7\pi/4)$$
$$-1/2 = \cos(\beta + 7\pi/4)$$

#### 2. Solve for the Argument
Let $X = \beta + 7\pi/4$. We are looking for values where $\cos(X) = -1/2$.
Cosine is negative in **Quadrant II** and **Quadrant III**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\pi/3$ (or $60^\circ$)
* **Quadrant II:** $X = \pi - \pi/3 = 2\pi/3$
* **Quadrant III:** $X = \pi + \pi/3 = 4\pi/3$

#### 3. Solve for $\beta$
Now, set the argument back to $\beta + 7\pi/4$ and solve for $\beta$ by subtracting $7\pi/4$ from each solution.

**Case 1:**
$$\beta + 7\pi/4 = 2\pi/3$$
$$\beta = 2\pi/3 - 7\pi/4$$
*Find a common denominator (12):*
$$\beta = 8\pi/12 - 21\pi/12 = -13\pi/12$$
Since this is negative, add $2\pi$ ($24\pi/12$) to find the coterminal angle in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$:
$$\beta = 11\pi/12$$

**Case 2:**
$$\beta + 7\pi/4 = 4\pi/3$$
$$\beta = 4\pi/3 - 7\pi/4$$
*Find a common denominator (12):*
$$\beta = 16\pi/12 - 21\pi/12 = -5\pi/12$$
Add $2\pi$ ($24\pi/12$) to bring it into the interval:
$$\beta = 19\pi/12$$

### $\cos(6x) = -\sin(4x) + \cos(2x)$

$\cos(6x) = -\sin(4x) + \cos(2x)$

To solve this equation for $x$ in the interval $[0, \pi)$, we will use the **Sum-to-Product identity** for cosine as requested.

---

#### 1. Rearrange the Equation
Move the cosine terms to one side to facilitate the use of the Sum-to-Product identity:
$$\cos(6x) - \cos(2x) = -\sin(4x)$$

#### 2. Apply the Sum-to-Product Identity
Using the identity $\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)$, let $A = 6x$ and $B = 2x$:
$$-2 \sin\left(\frac{6x+2x}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{6x-2x}{2}\right) = -\sin(4x)$$
$$-2 \sin(4x) \sin(2x) = -\sin(4x)$$

#### 3. Set to Zero and Factor
Do not divide by $\sin(4x)$, as you may lose solutions. Instead, add $\sin(4x)$ to both sides and factor:
$$\sin(4x) - 2 \sin(4x) \sin(2x) = 0$$
$$\sin(4x) \left[ 1 - 2 \sin(2x) \right] = 0$$

#### 4. Solve for $x$ in the interval $[0, \pi)$

**Case 1: $\sin(4x) = 0$**
If $0 \le x < \pi$, then the argument $4x$ spans $[0, 4\pi)$.
$$4x = 0, \pi, 2\pi, 3\pi$$
$$x = 0, \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4}$$

**Case 2: $1 - 2 \sin(2x) = 0 \implies \sin(2x) = 1/2$**
If $0 \le x < \pi$, then the argument $2x$ spans $[0, 2\pi)$.
* **Quadrant I:** $2x = \frac{\pi}{6} \implies x = \frac{\pi}{12}$
* **Quadrant II:** $2x = \frac{5\pi}{6} \implies x = \frac{5\pi}{12}$

### Solving Trigonometric Equations with Inverse Functions

When a trigonometric equation results in a value that is not found on the standard unit circle (e.g., $\sin \theta = 0.4$), we must use **Inverse Trigonometric Functions** to find the solutions.

---

#### 1. Definition and Notation
Inverse functions allow us to find the angle ($\theta$) when the trigonometric ratio is known.
* **If** $\sin \theta = y$, **then** $\theta = \arcsin(y)$ or $\sin^{-1}(y)$.
* **If** $\cos \theta = x$, **then** $\theta = \arccos(x)$ or $\cos^{-1}(x)$.
* **If** $\tan \theta = a$, **then** $\theta = \arctan(a)$ or $\tan^{-1}(a)$.

#### 2. The Reference Angle Strategy
Because calculators only provide a single value (the principal value), you must use it as a **reference angle** ($\theta_{ref}$) to find all solutions in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$.

1.  **Find the Reference Angle:** Calculate $\theta_{ref} = \text{trig}^{-1}(|value|)$. Always use the absolute (positive) value to ensure the reference angle is in Quadrant I.
2.  **Identify Quadrants:** Look at the sign of the original ratio to determine which quadrants the solutions lie in (e.g., if $\sin \theta$ is negative, look in QIII and QIV).
3.  **Calculate Specific Solutions:**
    * **QI:** $\theta = \theta_{ref}$
    * **QII:** $\theta = \pi - \theta_{ref}$ (or $180^\circ - \theta_{ref}$)
    * **QIII:** $\theta = \pi + \theta_{ref}$ (or $180^\circ + \theta_{ref}$)
    * **QIV:** $\theta = 2\pi - \theta_{ref}$ (or $360^\circ - \theta_{ref}$)

---

#### 3. Example Walkthrough
**Equation:** $5 \cos \theta + 3 = 0$ for $0^\circ \le \theta < 360^\circ$

* **Isolate the function:**
    $$5 \cos \theta = -3 \implies \cos \theta = -0.6$$
* **Find the reference angle:**
    $$\theta_{ref} = \cos^{-1}(0.6) \approx 53.1^\circ$$
* **Determine Quadrants:**
    Since cosine is **negative**, the solutions are in **Quadrant II** and **Quadrant III**.
* **Final Solutions:**
    * **QII:** $180^\circ - 53.1^\circ = 126.9^\circ$
    * **QIII:** $180^\circ + 53.1^\circ = 233.1^\circ$

### $\cos^{-1}\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$

This problem involves the composition of an inverse trigonometric function with its corresponding trigonometric function. 

---

#### 1. Analysis of the Property
Recall the inverse property for cosine:
$$\cos^{-1}(\cos(x)) = x \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \le x \le \pi$$

#### 2. Verify the Condition
To apply the identity directly, we must check if the input angle $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ falls within the restricted principal domain $[0, \pi]$:
* $0 \le \frac{\pi}{6} \le \pi$ is **True**.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation
If you prefer to solve it without the property:
1.  **Evaluate the inner function:** $$\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$
2.  **Evaluate the outer function:** $$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$$


---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$\cos^{-1}\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

### $\cos^{-1}\left(\cos \frac{5\pi}{4}\right)$

This problem requires evaluating the composition of an inverse trigonometric function with its corresponding function when the inner angle lies **outside** the principal domain.

---

#### 1. Analyze the Principle Domain
The identity $\cos^{-1}(\cos x) = x$ is only valid if $x$ is in the interval $[0, \pi]$.
* Our input is $x = \frac{5\pi}{4}$.
* Since $\frac{5\pi}{4} > \pi$, we **cannot** simply "cancel" the functions. The answer is not $\frac{5\pi}{4}$.

#### 2. Evaluate the Inner Function
Find the exact value of $\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)$ using the unit circle:
* The angle $\frac{5\pi}{4}$ is in **Quadrant III**.
* The reference angle is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
* $\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$


#### 3. Evaluate the Outer Function
Now, find $\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$. The inverse cosine function must return a value in the principal domain $[0, \pi]$ (Quadrants I or II):
* Since the value is negative, the result must be in **Quadrant II**.
* The angle in Quadrant II that has a cosine of $-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ is:
    $$\pi - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$$

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$\cos^{-1}\left(\cos \frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{3\pi}{4}$$

### $\sin^{-1}\left(\sin \frac{6\pi}{5}\right)$

This problem involves evaluating the composition of an inverse sine function with a sine function where the angle is outside the principal domain.

---

#### 1. Analyze the Principal Domain
The identity $\sin^{-1}(\sin x) = x$ only holds true if $x$ is within the interval $\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$.
* Our input is $x = \frac{6\pi}{5}$.
* Since $\frac{6\pi}{5}$ is greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (it is $1.2\pi$), we cannot simply cancel the functions.

#### 2. Locate the Angle and Value
Find where $\frac{6\pi}{5}$ lies on the unit circle:
* **Quadrant:** Since $\pi < \frac{6\pi}{5} < \frac{3\pi}{2}$, the angle is in **Quadrant III**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\theta_{ref} = \frac{6\pi}{5} - \pi = \frac{\pi}{5}$.
* **Sign:** In Quadrant III, sine is **negative**. Therefore, $\sin\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right) = -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$.


#### 3. Evaluate the Inverse Function
Now we find $\sin^{-1}$ of that negative value. The range of $\sin^{-1}$ is restricted to Quadrants I and IV $\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$.
* Because the value is negative, the result must be in **Quadrant IV**.
* In Quadrant IV, the angle with the same sine value as our Quadrant III angle is simply the negative of the reference angle:
    $$\sin^{-1}\left(\sin \frac{6\pi}{5}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{5}$$

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$\sin^{-1}\left(\sin \frac{6\pi}{5}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{5}$$

### $-5 + \frac{1}{2}\tan\left(-2x + \frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{11}{2}$

This equation combines multiple concepts: isolating a trigonometric function, handling a multiple-angle argument with a phase shift, and using inverse functions for angles in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Tangent Function
First, we move the constant terms to the right side:
* **Add 5 (which is $10/2$) to both sides:**
  $$\frac{1}{2}\tan\left(-2x + \frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{11}{2} + \frac{10}{2}$$
  $$\frac{1}{2}\tan\left(-2x + \frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}$$
* **Multiply by 2:**
  $$\tan\left(-2x + \frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = -1$$

#### 2. Solve for the Argument
Let $u = -2x + \frac{5\pi}{4}$. We need to find where $\tan(u) = -1$.
Tangent is negative in **Quadrant II** and **Quadrant IV**.
* **Reference Angle:** $\frac{\pi}{4}$
* **General Solutions for $u$:**
  $$u = \frac{3\pi}{4} + n\pi$$
  *(Where $n$ is any integer to account for multiple rotations)*

#### 3. Solve for $x$
Substitute the argument back and isolate $x$:
$$-2x + \frac{5\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4} + n\pi$$
* **Subtract $\frac{5\pi}{4}$:**
  $$-2x = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{5\pi}{4} + n\pi$$
  $$-2x = -\frac{2\pi}{4} + n\pi \implies -2x = -\frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$$
* **Divide by -2:**
  $$x = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{n\pi}{2}$$

#### 4. Find Solutions in $[0, 2\pi)$
We test integer values for $n$ to find all $x$ values within the required interval:
* **If $n = 0$:** $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ (Valid)
* **If $n = -1$:** $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$ (Valid)
* **If $n = -2$:** $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \pi = \frac{5\pi}{4}$ (Valid)
* **If $n = -3$:** $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{3\pi}{2} = \frac{7\pi}{4}$ (Valid)
* **If $n = -4$:** $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + 2\pi = \frac{9\pi}{4}$ (Out of range)

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Solution Set
> $$x = \left\{ \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{7\pi}{4} \right\}$$
### $40 \sin(\beta - 3) + 1 = 6$

In this version, we will maintain the exact fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ throughout the derivation to ensure maximum precision for your notes.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Sine Function
* **Subtract 1 from both sides:** $$40 \sin(\beta - 3) = 5$$
* **Divide by 40 and simplify the fraction:**
  $$\sin(\beta - 3) = \frac{5}{40} \implies \sin(\beta - 3) = \frac{1}{8}$$

#### 2. Find the Reference Angle
Since $\frac{1}{8}$ is not a standard value on the unit circle, we define the reference angle using the inverse sine function.
$$\text{ref angle} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)$$

#### 3. Determine Solutions for the Argument $(\beta - 3)$
The sine value is positive, which places the argument in **Quadrant I** and **Quadrant II**. Using the period of sine ($2\pi$):
* **Quadrant I:** $\beta - 3 = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 2\pi n$
* **Quadrant II:** $\beta - 3 = \left(\pi - \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)\right) + 2\pi n$

#### 4. Solve for $\beta$
Isolate $\beta$ by adding 3 to both general solution sets:
1.  $\beta = 3 + \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 2\pi n$
2.  $\beta = 3 + \pi - \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 2\pi n$

#### 5. Solutions in the Interval $[0, 2\pi)$
Given that $\sin^{-1}(1/8) \approx 0.1253$ and $\pi \approx 3.1415$, we find the specific values for $n=0$:
* **$\beta_1$:** $3 + 0.1253 \approx 3.1253$
* **$\beta_2$:** $3 + 3.1415 - 0.1253 \approx 6.0162$



---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Exact Solution Set
> $$\beta = \left\{ 3 + \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right), \quad 3 + \pi - \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) \right\}$$

### $\frac{3}{4} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}$

This equation requires isolating the inverse trigonometric function and then applying the definition of a "forward" trigonometric function to solve for $x$.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Inverse Cosine Function
To get $\cos^{-1}$ by itself, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$:
* **Multiply by $\frac{4}{3}$:**
  $$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3}$$
  $$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}$$

#### 2. Apply the Cosine Function
Using the definition of inverse functions, if $\cos^{-1}(A) = B$, then $\cos(B) = A$. 
* Take the cosine of both sides:
  $$\cos\left(\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$
  $$\frac{x}{2} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$

#### 3. Evaluate and Isolate $x$
* **Find the value on the unit circle:** Recall that $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$.
  * **Substitute and solve:**
  $$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$
  $$x = 1$$

#### 4. Verify the Range
The value of the inverse function $\frac{\pi}{3}$ must fall within the range of $\cos^{-1}$, which is $[0, \pi]$.
* $0 \le \frac{\pi}{3} \le \pi$ is **True**, so the solution is valid.

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$x = 1$$

### $\frac{1}{2} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{4}\right) = \pi$

This equation requires isolating the inverse trigonometric function and then verifying if the resulting output is compatible with the restricted range of that function.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Inverse Cosine Function
To isolate the $\cos^{-1}$ term, multiply both sides of the equation by $2$:
$$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{4}\right) = 2\pi$$

#### 2. Evaluate the Range Constraint
Recall the principal range for the inverse cosine function:
* For any $y = \cos^{-1}(u)$, the output $y$ must fall within the interval $[0, \pi]$.
* In this equation, the output is $2\pi$.


#### 3. Determine if a Solution Exists
Because $2\pi$ is outside the restricted range of $[0, \pi]$, there is no value of $x$ that can satisfy this principal value equation. 

---

#### Final Answer
> [!caution] No Solution
> There is **no solution** for $x$ because the value $2\pi$ is not within the range $[0, \pi]$ of the $\cos^{-1}$ function.
### $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - \sin^{-1}(x) = 0$

This equation requires relating two different inverse trigonometric functions. We can solve this by isolating the terms and using right-triangle trigonometry or trigonometric identities.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Inverse Functions
First, move $\sin^{-1}(x)$ to the right side of the equation:
$$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = \sin^{-1}(x)$$

#### 2. Interpret using Right Triangle Trigonometry
Let $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)$. This means:
$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$$

Since $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, we can visualize a right triangle where:
* **Adjacent side** = $3$
* **Hypotenuse** = $5$


#### 3. Find the Missing Side
Using the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$):
$$3^2 + \text{opposite}^2 = 5^2$$
$$9 + \text{opposite}^2 = 25$$
$$\text{opposite}^2 = 16 \implies \text{opposite} = 4$$

#### 4. Relate to Sine
Now, find the sine of the same angle $\theta$:
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{5}$$

Since $\theta = \sin^{-1}(x)$, we can substitute:
$$\sin(\sin^{-1}(x)) = \frac{4}{5}$$
$$x = \frac{4}{5}$$

#### 5. Alternative Method: Cofunction Identity
Recall the identity $\cos^{-1}(z) + \sin^{-1}(z) = \frac{\pi}{2}$. While this doesn't apply directly here, it reminds us that $\cos^{-1}(a) = \sin^{-1}(b)$ only when $a$ and $b$ are the legs of a triangle with hypotenuse 1, or specifically when $x = \sqrt{1 - (3/5)^2}$.

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$x = \frac{4}{5} \quad (\text{or } 0.8)$$
### $\sin^{-1}(x) - \cos^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{6}$

This equation can be solved by utilizing the cofunction identity for inverse trigonometric functions, which links $\sin^{-1}(x)$ and $\cos^{-1}(x)$.

---

#### 1. Identify the Relevant Identity
Recall the cofunction identity for inverse trigonometric functions:
$$\sin^{-1}(x) + \cos^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
From this, we can express $\cos^{-1}(x)$ in terms of $\sin^{-1}(x)$:
$$\cos^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \sin^{-1}(x)$$

#### 2. Substitute into the Original Equation
Replace $\cos^{-1}(x)$ in the problem with the expression derived above:
$$\sin^{-1}(x) - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \sin^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

#### 3. Solve for $\sin^{-1}(x)$
* **Simplify the left side:**
  $$\sin^{-1}(x) - \frac{\pi}{2} + \sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{6}$$
  $$2\sin^{-1}(x) - \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{6}$$
* **Add $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (which is $\frac{3\pi}{6}$) to both sides:**
  $$2\sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{3\pi}{6}$$
  $$2\sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{4\pi}{6} \implies 2\sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{2\pi}{3}$$
* **Divide by 2:**
  $$\sin^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{3}$$

#### 4. Find the value of $x$
Apply the sine function to both sides to isolate $x$:
$$x = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$
From the unit circle, we know that:
$$x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$


---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

### Summary: Solving Trigonometric Inequalities

Trigonometric inequalities are expressions where a trigonometric function is compared to a value using inequality symbols ($<, >, \le, \ge$). Solving them combines your knowledge of trigonometric equations with interval analysis.

---

#### 1. General Steps for Algebraic Solutions
1.  **Standardize the Inequality:** Move all terms to one side so the inequality is compared to zero (e.g., $f(x) > 0$).
2.  **Find Critical Values:** Replace the inequality sign with an equal sign and solve the resulting trigonometric equation. These values are where the function can cross the x-axis or change sign.
3.  **Identify Domain Restrictions:** Note where the function is undefined (e.g., asymptotes for $\tan(x)$ or $\sec(x)$). These also act as boundaries for your intervals.
4.  **Create a Sign Chart or Test Intervals:** Use the critical values and undefined points to split the number line (usually $[0, 2\pi]$) into intervals. Test a value from each interval in the original inequality to see if it is true (+) or false (-).
5.  **Write the Solution Set:** Combine the "true" intervals using union ($\cup$) notation.

#### 2. Visualizing with the Unit Circle
For simple inequalities like $\sin(x) > \frac{1}{2}$:
* **Identify the Boundaries:** Find the angles where $\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}$ ($\pi/6$ and $5\pi/6$).
* **Shade the Region:** Since sine represents the $y$-coordinate, shade the part of the circle where the $y$-value is above the line $y = 1/2$.
* **Read the Arc:** The solution is the arc between the two boundary points, moving counter-clockwise.

#### 3. Common Mistakes to Avoid
* **Losing Roots:** Never divide both sides by a trigonometric function (like dividing by $\sin(x)$), as you may delete a critical value. Factor instead.
* **Ignoring Asymptotes:** Always include points where the function is undefined (like $\pi/2$ for tangent) as interval boundaries.
* **Periodicity:** If the domain is not restricted (e.g., "solve for all $x$"), remember to add $+ 2n\pi$ to your solution intervals.
* **Sign Flips:** Remember that multiplying or dividing by a negative number flips the inequality sign.

---
### $4 - \sin(x) > \frac{7}{2}$ for $0 \le x < 2\pi$

This is a trigonometric inequality. To solve it, we isolate the trigonometric function and use interval analysis on the unit circle within the specified domain.

---

#### 1. Isolate the Sine Function
First, we perform algebraic steps to isolate $\sin(x)$:
* **Subtract 4 from both sides:** Note that $4 = \frac{8}{2}$, so:
  $$-\sin(x) > \frac{7}{2} - \frac{8}{2}$$
  $$-\sin(x) > -\frac{1}{2}$$
* **Multiply by -1:** Remember that multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number **flips the inequality sign**:
  $$\sin(x) < \frac{1}{2}$$

#### 2. Find the Critical Values
Set the inequality to an equality to find the boundary points on the interval $[0, 2\pi)$:
$$\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}$$
From the unit circle, we know sine is $1/2$ at:
* $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$
* $x = \frac{5\pi}{6}$


#### 3. Analyze the Intervals
We need the regions where the $y$-value (sine) is **less than** $1/2$.
* **Interval 1 $[0, \frac{\pi}{6})$:** Test $x=0$. $\sin(0) = 0$, which is $< 1/2$. (**True**)
* **Interval 2 $(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6})$:** Test $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$. $\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1$, which is NOT $< 1/2$. (**False**)
* **Interval 3 $(\frac{5\pi}{6}, 2\pi)$:** Test $x=\pi$. $\sin(\pi) = 0$, which is $< 1/2$. (**True**)

#### 4. Construct the Solution Set
Since the original inequality was strictly "greater than" (leading to "less than" after the sign flip), we use parentheses to exclude the boundary points where the value is exactly $1/2$.

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right) \cup \left(\frac{5\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right)$$
### $-2\cos^2(x) \ge 1 + 3\cos(x)$ for $0 \le x < 2\pi$

This is a quadratic trigonometric inequality. To solve it, we treat it similarly to a quadratic polynomial inequality, find the critical values, and analyze the intervals on the unit circle.

---

#### 1. Set the Inequality to Zero
First, move all terms to one side to create a quadratic form:
$$-2\cos^2(x) - 3\cos(x) - 1 \ge 0$$
Multiply the entire inequality by $-1$ to make the leading coefficient positive (remember to **flip the inequality sign**):
$$2\cos^2(x) + 3\cos(x) + 1 \le 0$$

#### 2. Factor the Quadratic Expression
Let $u = \cos(x)$. The expression becomes $2u^2 + 3u + 1 \le 0$. 
Factoring the quadratic:
$$(2\cos(x) + 1)(\cos(x) + 1) \le 0$$

#### 3. Find Critical Values
Set each factor to zero to find the boundary points within $[0, 2\pi)$:
* **Factor 1:** $2\cos(x) + 1 = 0 \implies \cos(x) = -1/2$
    * $x = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3}$
* **Factor 2:** $\cos(x) + 1 = 0 \implies \cos(x) = -1$
    * $x = \pi$


#### 4. Interval Analysis
We need to find where the product of the factors is less than or equal to zero. This occurs when the cosine value $u$ is between the two roots of the quadratic:
$$-1 \le \cos(x) \le -\frac{1}{2}$$

Looking at the unit circle for $x$-coordinates (cosine) between $-1$ and $-1/2$:
* At $x = \pi$, $\cos(x) = -1$.
* At $x = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$, $\cos(x) = -1/2$.
* The cosine values stay between $-1$ and $-1/2$ for the entire arc connecting these points.

#### 5. Construct the Solution Set
Since the inequality is $\le$, we include the endpoints where the expression equals zero.

---

#### Final Answer
> [!success] Result
> $$x \in \left[ \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3} \right]$$
### $\cot^2(x) - 3\csc(x) + 3 > 0$ for $0 \le x < 2\pi$

This quadratic trigonometric inequality uses reciprocal functions. To solve it, we must first convert the expression into a single trigonometric ratio using a Pythagorean identity.

---

#### 1. Use the Pythagorean Identity
Recall the identity linking cotangent and cosecant:
$$\cot^2(x) = \csc^2(x) - 1$$

Substitute this into the original inequality:
$$(\csc^2(x) - 1) - 3\csc(x) + 3 > 0$$
$$\csc^2(x) - 3\csc(x) + 2 > 0$$

#### 2. Factor the Quadratic
Let $u = \csc(x)$. The inequality becomes $u^2 - 3u + 2 > 0$.
Factoring the quadratic:
$$(\csc(x) - 1)(\csc(x) - 2) > 0$$

#### 3. Determine Critical Values and Domain Restrictions
* **Asymptotes:** $\csc(x)$ is undefined where $\sin(x) = 0$. In $[0, 2\pi)$, these are **$x = 0$ and $x = \pi$**.
* **Zeros:** Set the factors to zero:
    * $\csc(x) = 1 \implies \sin(x) = 1 \implies$ **$x = \pi/2$**
    * $\csc(x) = 2 \implies \sin(x) = 1/2 \implies$ **$x = \pi/6, 5\pi/6$**

#### 4. Interval Analysis
We look for regions where the product is positive ($> 0$). This occurs when:
**$\csc(x) < 1$** or **$\csc(x) > 2$**.

* **$\csc(x) > 2$:** On the unit circle, this happens when $0 < \sin(x) < 1/2$ (in Quadrants I and II).
    * Intervals: $(0, \pi/6)$ and $(5\pi/6, \pi)$.
* **$\csc(x) < 1$:** Since the range of cosecant is $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$, $\csc(x)$ is only "less than 1" when it is negative (Quadrants III and IV).
    * In QIII and QIV, $\csc(x)$ is always $\le -1$, which satisfies the condition $(\text{negative}) \times (\text{negative}) = \text{positive}$.
    * Interval: $(\pi, 2\pi)$.

![[Pasted image 20260211154352.png]]
### Law of Sines

The **Law of Sines** is a powerful relationship between the sides and angles of any triangle (not just right triangles). It states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides.

---

#### 1. The Formula
Based on the standard labeling of triangle $ABC$ where side $a$ is opposite $\angle A$, side $b$ is opposite $\angle B$, and side $c$ is opposite $\angle C$:

$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$


#### 2. Derivation from the Altitude ($h$)
In your provided image, the altitude $h$ (segment $BD$) creates two right triangles, $ABD$ and $CBD$. We can use these to see why the law works:
1.  In $\triangle ABD$: $\sin A = \frac{h}{c} \implies h = c \sin A$
2.  In $\triangle CBD$: $\sin C = \frac{h}{a} \implies h = a \sin C$
3.  Since both equal $h$: $c \sin A = a \sin C$
4.  Rearranging gives: $\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$

#### 3. Application: Side-Angle-Angle (SAA)
When you know **two angles and one side**, the Law of Sines is your primary tool.
* **Step 1:** Use the Triangle Sum Theorem ($180^\circ$) to find the third angle.
* **Step 2:** Set up a proportion using the known side/angle pair and the side you wish to find.
* **Example:** If you know $\angle A$, $\angle B$, and side $a$, you find side $b$ using:
    $$b = \frac{a \sin B}{\sin A}$$

#### 4. Application: Side-Angle-Side (SAS)
**Warning:** The Law of Sines cannot be used *directly* to solve a triangle starting with SAS because you do not have a complete "ratio" (a side and its opposite angle).
* **Correct Approach:** Use the **Law of Cosines** first to find the third side.
* **Next Step:** Once the third side is found, you now have a side/angle pair and can use the Law of Sines to find the remaining smaller angles.
