- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
