- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
- **Right Angle** : Exactly 90 Degrees
- **Obtuse Angle** : Greater than 90 degrees, less than 180 degrees
- **Straight Angle** : 180 degrees
- **Complementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 90 degrees, they are *complementary*
- **Supplementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 180 degrees, they are *supplementary*
## 2026-January-04 - Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds :

- $1\degree$ = $\frac{1}{360}$ : 360 degrees in a circle 
- What happens when you need to measure a rotation that is less than a degree? *Minutes*, and *seconds* are portions/fractions of a degree.
- $125^\circ 30' 45''$ : Standard Notation for *Degrees $\degree$*, *Minutes $'$*, *Seconds $''$* 
- $60'$ = $\frac{1\degree}{60}$ : $60'$ minutes in one degree ($1\degree$)
- $60''$ = $\frac{1'}{60}$ : $60''$ seconds in one minute($1'$)
- $1'' = \frac{1'}{60} = \frac{1\degree}{3600}$ : 1 second is 1/3600th (60 * 60) of a degree
- $37^\circ 15' 45''$ + $19^\circ 50' 17''$  = $57^\circ 6' 2''$ : Once you understand it, you just need to know the carrying process (every 60 seconds is a minute, every 60 minutes is a degree)
- $14^\circ 18' 30''$ - $9^\circ 25' 50''$ = $4\degree 52' 40''$ 
- To find the complement(what adds up to 90 degrees), just borrow from the degrees for the minutes, and borrow from those new minutes for the seconds
- $114.09\degree$ = $114\degree 5' 24''$ : How to go from Decimal form to degrees, minutes and seconds. simply multiply the fractional degree (in this case, '0.09' = 5.4) by 60, then take whatever fractional part is remaining('0.4' * 60 = 24) and multiply that by 60 again for the seconds 
- If you have a TI 83 / 84 : type the number(fractional degrees)  into the calculator look for the **Angle** button, then press **DMS** button and it will convert it for you
- To convert from degrees minutes seconds to a fractional degree, simply divide the *seconds $'$* by '60' and the *minutes* by '3600' then add that to your degrees

### Trigonometry: Angles in Standard Position & Coterminal Angles

#### 1. Angles in Standard Position
An angle is in **standard position** when its vertex is at the origin $(0,0)$ of the Cartesian plane and its **initial side** lies along the positive x-axis.

* **Positive Angles:** Measured **counterclockwise** from the initial side.
* **Negative Angles:** Measured **clockwise** from the initial side.
* **Terminal Side:** The ray where the angle measurement ends.
* **Quadrantal Angles:** Angles whose terminal sides lie exactly on an axis ($0^\circ, 90^\circ, 180^\circ, 270^\circ$, etc.).

#### 2. Coterminal Angles
Coterminal angles are angles in standard position that share the same **terminal side**. Although they look the same on a graph, they have different measures because they differ by one or more full rotations.

**Finding Coterminal Angles:**
To find an angle coterminal to a given angle $\theta$, add or subtract multiples of $360^\circ$ (for degrees) or $2\pi$ (for radians).

* **Degrees:** $\theta \pm 360^\circ n$
* **Radians:** $\theta \pm 2\pi n$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

#### 3. Summary Table for Obsidian

| Term | Definition | Formula / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Side** | Starting ray of the angle | Always the positive x-axis. |
| **Terminal Side** | Ending ray of the angle | Determines the quadrant. |
| **Positive Angle** | Counterclockwise rotation | Example: $+120^\circ$ |
| **Negative Angle** | Clockwise rotation | Example: $-45^\circ$ |
| **Coterminal** | Different measures, same terminal side | Add/Subtract $360^\circ$ or $2\pi$. |

#### 4. Practice Examples
* **Find a positive coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ + 360^\circ = 405^\circ$
* **Find a negative coterminal angle for $45^\circ$:**
    $45^\circ - 360^\circ = -315^\circ$
* **Find the smallest positive coterminal angle for $\frac{13\pi}{4}$:**
    $\frac{13\pi}{4} - 2\pi = \frac{13\pi}{4} - \frac{8\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{4}$

## Vertical Angles :
- **Vertical Angles** : Angles that are opposite eachother where the 2 lines cross - The opposite side angles will be the same equal measures
![[Pasted image 20260105142242.png]]
- 1 and 3 are opposites and will be the same
- 2 and 4 are opposites and will be the same
- 1 and 2 are supplementary angles and will add up to 180 degrees
- 3 and 4 are supplementary as well and will also add up to 180 degrees
### Transversal intersects 2 parallel Lines : 
![[Pasted image 20260105142125.png]]
- **Interior Angles** Are the angles on the interior of the parallel lines
- **Alternate Interior Angles** : are angles that will have equal measures (3 and 6, 5 and 4)
- 3 and 6 will be the equal angle measurements
- 4 and 5 will be the equal angle measurements
- **Exterior Angles** : Are the angles outside the interior parallel lines
- **Alternate Exterior Angles** : Alternate Exterior Angles will have exterior measures (1 and 8, 2 and 7)
- 2 and 7 will be the equal angle measurements
- 1 and 8 will be the equal angle measurements
- Since 7 and 8 are supplementary angles(add up to 180), and 2 = 7 : 
  7 :$(11x-53)\degree$
  8 : $(4x+8)\degree$ 
  7+ 8 : $11x -53 +4x + 8 = 180\degree$
  15x - 45 = 180
  15x = 225
  x = 15 
  Plug x into the angles to get their measurement 
  2 and 7 :  $(11x-53)\degree$ : 11(15) - 53 : 165 - 53 : $112\degree$
  1 and 8 :  $(4x+8)\degree$ : 4(15) + 8 : $68\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so : 7, 6, 2, 3 = $112\degree$ 
- Vertical Angles have the same measurement, so 1, 4, 5 , 8 = $68\degree$ 
### Triangle Sum 180
![[Pasted image 20260105144919.png]]
- The sum of the measure of any triangle will always be 180 degrees
- 6x + 1 + 10x - 56 + 43 = 180 : 16x -12 = 180 : 16x  = 192 : x = 12
- Plug 12 into x for the other 2 angles :
  1: 6(12) + 1 : $73\degree$ 
  2: 10(12) - 56 : $64\degree$ 
  3 : $43\degree$ 
  Check : $73\degree + 64\degree + 43\degree = 180\degree$ 
## Similar Triangles :
![[Pasted image 20260105145810.png]]
- Similar Triangles Must have the same measure of angles 
- corresponding angles must have same measures
- So A = D, F = C, E = B
  A and  D = $18\degree$ 
  F and C = $144\degree$ 
  All triangles add up to 180 degrees :
  B and E = $180\degree - 144\degree - 18\degree = 18\degree$
