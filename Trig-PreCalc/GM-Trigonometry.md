## 2026-January-04 - Angles in Trigonometry :

- A<-------->B = Line AB
- **Line Segment** : No arrows, only part of a line
- **Ray** : Starts at one point and continues indefinitely
- **Angle** : An angle will consists of 2 different rays with the same endpoint
- **Vertex** : The common angle of the 2 rays
- $\angle$ : Symbol for Angle 
- You can use $\angle CAB$, $\angle BAC$, OR $\angle A$ : They all mean the same things, the angle of the *vertex* 'A' inbetween 2 *rays* 'B' and 'C' 
- **Initial Side** : Where your angle Starts
- **Terminal Side** : Where your angle Ends
- **Positive Angle** : When you rotate counterclockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *positive angle*
- **Negative Angle** : When you rotate clockwise from the *Intital side* to the *terminal side* the angle that is generated is a *negative angle*
- **Degree** : $\degree$ : 360 Degrees to one complete rotation of a ray
- $\theta$ : Greek Letter Theta represents an unknown angle
- **Acute Angle** : Where the measure of the angle is less than 90 degrees, but greater than 0
- **Right Angle** : Exactly 90 Degrees
- **Obtuse Angle** : Greater than 90 degrees, less than 180 degrees
- **Straight Angle** : 180 degrees
- **Complementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 90 degrees, they are *complementary*
- **Supplementary Angle** : When the sum of the measures of 2 angles is 180 degrees, they are *supplementary*
## 2026-January-04 - Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds :

- $1\degree$ = $\frac{1}{360}$ : 360 degrees in a circle 
- What happens when you need to measure a rotation that is less than a degree? *Minutes*, and *seconds* are portions/fractions of a degree.
- $125^\circ 30' 45''$ : Standard Notation for *Degrees $\degree$*, *Minutes $'$*, *Seconds $''$* 
- $60'$ = $\frac{1\degree}{60}$ : $60'$ minutes in one degree ($1\degree$)
- $60''$ = $\frac{1'}{60}$ : $60''$ seconds in one minute($1'$)
- $1'' = \frac{1'}{60} = \frac{1\degree}{3600}$ : 1 second is 1/3600th (60 * 60) of a degree
- $37^\circ 15' 45''$ + $19^\circ 50' 17''$  = $57^\circ 6' 2''$ : Once you understand it, you just need to know the carrying process (every 60 seconds is a minute, every 60 minutes is a degree)
- $14^\circ 18' 30''$ - $9^\circ 25' 50''$ = $4\degree 52' 40''$ 
- To find the complement(what adds up to 90 degrees), just borrow from the degrees for the minutes, and borrow from those new minutes for the seconds
- $114.09\degree$ = $114\degree 5' 24''$ : How to go from Decimal form to degrees, minutes and seconds. simply multiply the fractional degree (in this case, '0.09' = 5.4) by 60, then take whatever fractional part is remaining('0.4' * 60 = 24) and multiply that by 60 again for the seconds 
- If you have a TI 83 / 84 : type the number(fractional degrees)  into the calculator look for the **Angle** button, then press **DMS** button and it will convert it for you
- To convert from degrees minutes seconds to a fractional degree, simply divide the *seconds $'$* by '60' and the *minutes* by '3600' then add that to your degrees
