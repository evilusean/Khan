#### Preamble:
I had no notes on any of my courses, up until now, past sean appears to have just been copying and pasting syllabus'(i?) till now, started 2 years ago, because I thought 'you need math to code' - Nope. 
Since I want to take Electrical Engineering, I need to get my math up, So I can level up IRL, and escape frozen decadent rent seeking parasite infested overpriced economic zone failed state canada
Changed notes to '.md' so I can edit in obsidian, better UI than github, looks prettier.

- Function = Takes an input and returns an output. - will be deterministic - you can not associate 2 different outputs to one input, or it won't be a function
- $f(x)$ \#most used way to describe a function
- $y = x + 1$ \#This can also be a function
###### Worked example: Evaluating functions from equation

$f(x) = {x}^{2}-1$
- composing function = to build up a function by composing one function of others function, *nested functions* = $f(g(2))$ = Take the number 2, put it through the function `g` take that output an d put it through `f`
- in the video he has a chart where he is getting his $g(t)$ and a graph for $h(2)$ - so can't work out the formula

 the amount of corn, `C`, in kilograms (kg), that he expects to produce if he plants corn on `a` acres of land.
- $C(a) = 7500a - 1500$
- If he planted 2 acres : $C( 2) = 7500( 2)-1500= {13{,}{500}}$ 
What Cam really wants to know is how much money he will make from selling this corn. So he uses the following function to predict the amount of money, `M` in dollars, that he will earn from selling `c` kilograms of corn.
- $M(c) = 0.9c - 50$
So if Cam produces `13,500kg` of corn, he can expect to make 
- $M({13{,}500})=0.9({13{,}500})-50=\${12{,}100}$
Notice that Cam has to use _two_ separate functions to get from acres planted to expected earnings. The first function, `C`, takes acres to corn, while the second function, `M`, takes corn to money.
So, to find a general rule that converts \[a\] acres directly into expected earnings, we can find the expression 
- $M(C(a))$
The function below converts acres planted directly into expected earnings. Let's use this new function to predict the amount of money that Cam would make from planting corn on two acres.
- $M(C(a))=6750a-1400$
- $M(C(2))=6750(2)-1400=\$12{,}100$
**composite function**. = Instead of substituting acres planted into the corn function, and then substituting the amount of corn produced into the money function, we found a function that takes the acres planted directly to the expected earnings.

If $f(x) = 3x - 1$ 
and $g(x) = {x}^{3}+2$ 
what is $f(g(3))$? 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 * 3 = 87 - 1 = 86
In general, to indicate function `f` composed with function `g`, we can write `f * g`, read as "`f` composed with `g`". This composition is defined by the following rule:
$(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$
- - -
![[20241107062744.png]]
I'll break down how to solve this composition of functions step by step.
When we have $(h \circ g)(x)$, it means we're plugging function $g(x)$ into function $h(x)$. Let's follow the solution:
- First, we identify our functions:
- $g(x) = x + 4$
- $h(x) = x^2 - 2x$
- To find $(h \circ g)(x)$:
- *Take $g(x)$ and wherever you see $x$ in $h(x)$, replace it with $g(x)$*
- So we replace every $x$ in $h(x) = x^2 - 2x$ with $(x + 4)$
- Let's follow the steps:
- Start with $h(x) = x^2 - 2x$
- Replace $x$ with $(x + 4)$:
- $(x + 4)^2 - 2(x + 4)$
- Then expand:
- $(x + 4)^2$ becomes $x^2 + 8x + 16$ (using FOIL)
- $-2(x + 4)$ becomes $-2x - 8$
- Combine all terms:
- $x^2 + 8x + 16 - 2x - 8$
- $= x^2 + 6x + 8$ (final answer)
This is how we get the final composed function $(h \circ g)(x) = x^2 + 6x + 8$
To find $(h \circ g)(-2)$, you would simply plug in $x = -2$ into this final function:
$(-2)^2 + 6(-2) + 8 = 4 - 12 + 8 = 0$
- - - 
$f(x)=3x-5$
$g(x)=3-2x$
Evaluate $(g\circ f)(3)$
3 * 3 = 9 - 5 = 4 
-2(4) = -8 + 3 = `-5`
- - -
$f(t)=t-2$
$g(t)=t^2+5$
Find $(g\circ f)(t)$
Replace all instances of t with `t-2` so ${t}^{2}$ = $(t-2)(t-2)+5$ = `t2 -4t + 9`
- - -
$f(t)=t-2$
$g(t)=t^2+5$
Find $(f\circ g)(t)$
Replace all instances of t with ${t}^{2}+5$ = ${t}^{2}+3$ 
- *After you know the trick, it's way easier. Replace the first ones `g(t)` with the second ones* `f(t)` - I was wondering why you didn't have to balance each side of the equation at the start, it's replacement instead
###### Evaluating composite functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxtlwnCV-HM&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
$g(x) = {x}^{2} + 5x - 3$
$h(y) = {3(y-1)}^{2} - 5$
$(h \circ g)(-6) = ?$ you can rewrite this equation as $h(g(-6))$
`g(-6)` = (-6)(-6) + 5(-6) - 3 = 36 -30 -3 = `3` 
`h(3)` =  $3{(3-1)}^{2}-5$ = $3{(2)}^{2} -5$ = 12 - 5 = `7`
- '$\circ$' \#  the circle isn't just a weird way of saying multiply, it's actually a symbol that stands for *function composition symbol*

#### 4:Piecewise Functions-2024-11-09 :
###### Introduction to piecewise functions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tedzsRH0Jas&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
*PieceWise Function* = A function that is defined piece by piece for different intervals
for each interval or section it is defined as '$-9, -9<x\geq -5$' \# this will show that for the x axis -9 to -5, the value will be 9 on the y axis(yes, each one, it is flat), notice the ',' comma seperates the y value from x values, each interval will be multiple numbers on the x axis
- also note, that an interval is defined on the graph with an open $\circ$ circle to a closed circle
- also note, that all three cases are wrapped in the same '{' large curly brace
- open circle means that it is < or >
- closed circle means $\geq or \leq$
###### Worked example: evaluating piecewise functions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg2HR9zJFq4&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
${t}^{2} - 5t, t \geq -10$ \# this will have us replace the 't' with -10, so replace an 't'
$f(-10) = {-10}^{2}-5(-10)$ = 100 + 50 = *150*
- use the correct case for the function, there will be multiple intervals, so h(-3) would use the case with the value for -3, if that's unclear, just watch the video again around 1:45, it's only 5 mins long - don't want to write out all the superfluous stuff
${x}^{3}$ = ${-3}^{3}$ = *-27*

###### Intro to factors & divisibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjN3_xCJamA
*Factor* = A _factor_ of a number is a number that divides the given number evenly or exactly, leaving no remainder
What are the factors of *12*(what can multiply to get 12) = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
	`1 * 12 = 12` or `2 * 6 = 12` or `3 * 4 = 12` 
Is it divisible by a `#` ?
$(x+3)(x+7) = {x}^{2} + 10x + 21$ 
since we multiplied (FOIL) to get :
${x}^{2} + 10x + 21$ is a divisible by $(x+3) or  (x+7)$ 
$(x+3) or  (x+7)$ is a factor of ${x}^{2} + 10x + 21$
###### Intro to factors & divisibility-Text-2024-11-13:

A **monomial** is an expression that is the product of constants and nonnegative integer powers of `x`, like $3x^2$. 
A **polynomial** is an expression that consists of a sum of monomials, like $3x^2+6x-1$
- In this lesson, we will explore the relationship between factors and divisibility in polynomials and also learn how to determine if one polynomial is a factor of another.
- In general, two integers that multiply to obtain a number are considered **factors** of that number.
- For example, since $14=2* 7$, we know that \[2\] and \[7\] are **factors** of 14.
- When two or more polynomials are multiplied, we call each of these polynomials **factors** of the product.
-  $2x(x+3)=2x^2+6x$. This means that `2x` and `(x+3)` are factors of $2x^2+6x$.
- Also, one polynomial is **divisible** by another polynomial if the quotient is also a polynomial.
- *Quotient* = A result obtained by dividing one quantity by another
-  $\frac{6x^2}{3x}=2x$  then $6x^2$ is divisible by `3x` and `2x`.
- In general, if $p=q*r$ for polynomials `p`, `q`, and `r`, then we know the following:
- \[q\] and \[r\] are factors of \[p\].
- \[p\] is divisible by \[q\] and \[r\].
- If something is divisible by something else then that something else is a factor
- *Why are we interested in factoring polynomials?*
- Just as factoring integers turned out to be very useful for a variety of applications, so is polynomial factorization!
- Specifically, polynomial factorization is very useful in solving quadratic equations and simplifying rational expressions.

$x^{2}-3x-10$ Factor this as the product of 2 binomials $(x+a)(x+b)$
$x^{2}+ax+bx+ab$ using FOIL this is what you should get
`ax + bx` needs to equal `-3x` and multiply to `-10`
Answer : $(x + 2)(x - 5)$
###### Factoring quadratics: leading coefficient = 1

In this lesson, you will learn how to factor a polynomial of the form $x^{2}+bx+c$ as a product of two binomials.
$(x+2)(x+4) = x^{2}+6x+8$
 *Factoring trinomials* :We can reverse the process of binomial multiplication shown above in order to factor a trinomial (which is a polynomial with 3 terms). $x^{2}+6x+8 = (x+2)(x+4)$
 - $x^{2}+5x+6 = (x+2)(x+3)$
 - $x^{2}+7x+10 = (x+2)(x+5)$
 - $x^{2}+9x+20 = (x+4)(x+5)$
 -  $x^{2}-5x+6 = (x-3)(x-2)$
 -  $x^{2}-x+6 = (x+2)(x-3)$
 *The sum-product pattern* = $(x+m)(x+n) = x^{2}+(m+n)x + m*n$
 **Can this factorization method be used to factor $2x^2+3x+1$?** = No. 
 - In general, the sum-product method is only applicable when we can actually write a trinomial as $(x+m)(x+n)$ for some integers `m` and `n`.
- This means that the leading term of the trinomial must be $x^2$ (and not, for instance, $2x^2$) in order to even consider this method. This is because the product of `(x+m)` and `(x+n)` will always be a polynomial with a leading term of $x^2$.
- not all trinomials with $x^2$ as a leading term can be factored. For example, $x^2+2x+2$ cannot be factored because there are no two integers whose sum is 2 and whose product is 2.
$x^{2}+5xy+6y^{2}$ = $(x+2y)(x+3y)$ = Uses the same process just with `y` though
 $x^4-5x^2+6$ = $(x^{2})^{2}-5x^{2}+6$ = $(x^{2}-2)(x^{2}-3)$
