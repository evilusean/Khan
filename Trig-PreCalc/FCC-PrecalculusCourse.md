## 2025-December-24 - Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=20
- Definition. A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and out-put numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value).
- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation. : $y = x^2 + 1$, which can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ : 
- $f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ 
- $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$
- $f(a+3) = a^2 + 6a + 10$ 
- not even 2 minutes into the video and she is already talking about 'functions' as 'mothers' and how you can have infinite mothers.. - Do I really want to listen to this for 5 and a half hours?
- Sometimes a function is described as a graph instead of an equation
- 
- Definition. The **domain** of a function is all possible **x-values.**  
- The **range** is the **y-values**.
- To find domain of a function, exclude 'x' values that make the denominator '0'. Also exclude 'x' values that make an expression inside a square root negative
## 2025-December-24 - Increasing and Decreasing Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=12m05s
- green line go up = positive = inceasing
- blue line go down = negative = decreasing
## 2025-December-24 - Maximums and Minimums on a Graphs :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=17m35s
- **Maximum** A function f(x) has an absolute maximum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as big as it ever gets
- **Minimum** A function f(x) has an absolute minimum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as small as it ever gets
- **Global Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another word for absolute maximum/minimum values
- **Local Maximum** = If it is larger than any nearby y values
- **Local Minimum** = If it is smaller than any nearby y values
- **Relative Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another name for local minimum/maximum values
## 2025-December-24 - Even and Odd Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=26m40s
![[Pasted image 20251224163701.png]]
- A graph is symmetric in respect to the x axis, y axis, origin if... Not typing all that out, and describing each graph.
- **Symmetric X Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with X axis (x,y) is mirrored by the same points on (x, -y)
- **Symmetric Y Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with Y axis (x,y) is mirroed on the same point with (-x, y)
- **Symmetric Origin** = Mirror Symmetry with origin (0,0) - it has $180\degree$ degree rotational symmetry -  is mirrored by inverting it upside down and should look exactly the same, (x,y) = (-x,-y)
- **Even/Odd Functions** = Used to describe functions which graphs have certain kinds of symmetry
- **Even Function** = A graph is even if it's graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis : (x, f(x)) is mirrored by (-x, f(-x)) : aka f(-x) = f(x) for all x values in it's domain, aka same height at 'x' and '-x'
- **Odd Function** = A graph is odd if it's graph is symmetric with respect to it's origin : (x, y) is mirrored by (-x, -y) : aka f(-x) = -f(x)
- There's no word for functions that are symmetric to the x axis - because if it is symmetric with the x-axis, it's not a function (won't pass the vertical line test)
## 2025-December-25 - Toolkit Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=36m15s
- $y = x$ : creates a line
- $y = x^2$ : creates a parabola
- $y = x^3$ : creates a cubic odd function
- $y = \sqrt{x}$ : creates a square root function
- $y = |x|$ : creates a 'V'
- $y = 2^x$ : creates an exponential function
- $y = \frac{1}{x}$ : creates a hyperobla odd function
- $y = \frac{1}{x^2}$ : creates an even function asymptote
- You should memorize what each function looks like for future Sean
## 2025-December-26 - Transformations of Functions : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=43m20s
- If you change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function transforms.
- $y=\sqrt{x} - 2$ : moves the graph down 2 on the y axis 
- $y= \sqrt{x-2}$ : moves the graph right (counterintuitive) on the x axis - since the equation now has to add 2 units to the graph, to get it to the right original positioning, it moves it right. 
- Rules for transformations: 
  - Numbers on the outside of the function affect the y-values and result in vertical motions. These motions are in the direction you expect.
- Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x-values and result in horizontal motions. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect.
- Adding results in a shift (translations)
- Multiplying results in a stretch or shrink
-  A negative sign results in a reflection
- $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$ : The multiplier will also be inverted, this will actually **stretch** (counterintuitive, not shrink) the graph on the horizontal axis - a vertical shrink of one half$y = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x}$ is the same as a horizontal stretch of $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$
## 2025-December-26 - Piecewise Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=55m50s
- A **Piecewise Function** = is a function which is defined in pieces. : 
  f(x) = 
  '$-x^2$ if $x<1$'
   '$-2x+3$ if $x \ge 1$' 
- If a piecewise function is **continuous** if one piece connects directly to another piece, if there is a jump on the points of the function, it is **not continuous, discontinuous**
## 2025-December-27 - Inverse Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h20s
- **Inverse Function** = Undoes what a function does. : 
  $f(x) = x+2$ 
  $f^{-1}(x)=x -2$ 
- Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
- This is the mathematical way of saying that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ undo each other.
   $f^{-1} \circ f(x) = x$ 
  $f \circ f^{-1}(x) = x$ . 
- $\circ$ = **Function Composition Symbol** = Function composition is the process of combining two functions into a single new function by using the **output** of the first (inner) function as the **input** for the second (outer) function.
- Not all functions have an inverse function : They must be a 1 to 1 function, also, exponential functions will not work : $f(x) = x^2$ can be positive or negative - Only a function that satisfies the *horizontal line test* has an inverse function **One To One Functions** have an inverse function
### Inverse $\neq$ Reciprocal

It is a common mistake to think $f^{-1}(x)$ means the same thing as $\frac{1}{f(x)}$. While they use similar notation, they represent entirely different mathematical concepts.

---

#### The Core Difference
| Concept        | Notation                          | Meaning                    | Goal                                  |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Inverse**    | $f^{-1}(x)$                       | **Reverse Mapping**        | To "undo" the action of the function. |
| **Reciprocal** | $[f(x)]^{-1}$ or $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ | **Multiplicative Inverse** | To flip the output into a fraction.   |

---

#### Numerical Comparison
Let's use a simple function $f(x) = 2x$ with an input of $x = 3$.
* **Original Output:** $f(3) = 6$

**The Inverse ($f^{-1}$)**
The inverse "reverses" $2x$ to $\frac{x}{2}$.
$$f^{-1}(6) = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$
*Result: We returned to the original input.*

**The Reciprocal ($\frac{1}{f}$)**
The reciprocal simply flips the result ($6$).
$$\frac{1}{f(3)} = \frac{1}{6}$$
*Result: We just get a fraction.*

---

> [!TIP]
> To keep your notes clear, always think: **Inverse** = "Go Backwards", **Reciprocal** = "Flip Upside Down".
### The Domain-Range Swap

When you create an inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$, you are fundamentally reversing the direction of the mapping. This results in a total swap of the Domain and Range.

---

#### The Swap Rule
Because an inverse function "undoes" the original, the inputs and outputs switch roles:
* **$\text{Domain of } f$** $\rightarrow$ **$\text{Range of } f^{-1}$**
* **$\text{Range of } f$** $\rightarrow$ **$\text{Domain of } f^{-1}$**

#### Why It Happens
1. **Algebraically:** To find $f^{-1}(x)$, we replace $f(x)$ with $y$, then literally **swap $x$ and $y$**. Since $x$ is the domain and $y$ is the range, the swap is built into the math.
2. **Graphically:** Every point $(a, b)$ on the graph of $f$ becomes the point $(b, a)$ on the graph of $f^{-1}$. This creates a reflection over the line $y = x$.

---

#### Case Study: $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$
Let's see how the boundaries move:

| Feature      | Original $f(x)$ | Inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ |
| :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| **Equation** | $\sqrt{x-2}$    | $x^2 + 2$           |
| **Domain**   | $[2, \infty)$   | $[0, \infty)$       |
| **Range**    | $[0, \infty)$   | $[2, \infty)$       |

> [!WARNING] Restriction Requirement
> Notice that the **Range** of the original function ($[0, \infty)$) dictates the **Domain** of the inverse. Even though $x^2+2$ usually accepts any number, as an inverse of $\sqrt{x-2}$, its domain must be restricted to $x \ge 0$.
### Graphical Reflection: $y = x$

The most distinct visual characteristic of an inverse function is its symmetry. If you plot both $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ on the same coordinate plane, the graph of the inverse is a **reflection** of the original graph across the identity line $y = x$.

---

#### 1. The Geometry of the Reflection
Because the inverse function is created by swapping every $x$-coordinate with every $y$-coordinate, the physical position of every point $(a, b)$ on the original curve moves to $(b, a)$ for the inverse.

* **The Reflection Line:** $y = x$ acts as a "mirror."
* **Point Transformation:** * If $f(x)$ passes through $(2, 5)$, then $f^{-1}(x)$ must pass through $(5, 2)$.
	* If $f(x)$ passes through $(-1, 4)$, then $f^{-1}(x)$ must pass through $(4, -1)$.

---

#### 2. Visualizing the Symmetry
Imagine folding your graph paper along the diagonal line $y = x$. The curve of the original function would land exactly on top of the curve of the inverse function.

* **Intersections:** If the original function $f(x)$ ever crosses the line $y = x$, the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ will cross at that exact same point (since swapping $x$ and $y$ when they are equal changes nothing).
* **Perpendicularity:** The line segment connecting a point $(a, b)$ to its reflected point $(b, a)$ is always perpendicular to the line $y = x$.

---

#### 3. Why This Matters for "One-to-One" Functions
For a function to have an inverse that is also a function, it must pass the **Horizontal Line Test**. 
* If a horizontal line touches $f(x)$ twice, then after the reflection across $y=x$, a **vertical line** would touch the new graph twice.
* This is why we must restrict the domain of parabolas (like $y=x^2$) before reflecting them; otherwise, the reflection would be a "sideways" parabola that fails the vertical line test.

---

#### 4. Quick Sketch Guide
1. Draw the line **$y = x$** as a dashed diagonal.
2. Identify 3-4 key points on $f(x)$ (intercepts, vertex, etc.).
3. **Swap the coordinates** for those points.
4. Plot the new points and connect them, maintaining the "mirrored" curvature.
### Inverse Functions: $f(x) = \frac{5-x}{3x}$

An **inverse function** $f^{-1}(x)$ reverses the effect of the original function. Essentially, if $f$ maps $x$ to $y$, then $f^{-1}$ maps $y$ back to $x$.

---

#### 1. Finding the Inverse
To find the inverse of $f(x) = \frac{5-x}{3x}$, follow these algebraic steps:

1. **Set to $y$:** $y = \frac{5-x}{3x}$
2. **Swap $x$ and $y$:** $x = \frac{5-y}{3y}$
3. **Solve for the new $y$:** $x(3y) = 5 - y$  
   $3xy + y = 5$  
   $y(3x + 1) = 5$  
   $y = \frac{5}{3x+1}$

**Result:** $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{5}{3x+1}$$

---

#### 2. How it Works (The Composition Rule)
Inverse functions are defined by the fact that their **composition** results in the identity function $x$. In Obsidian/MathJax notation:

$$(f \circ f^{-1})(x) = x \quad \text{and} \quad (f^{-1} \circ f)(x) = x$$

#### Numerical Example:
* **Original:** If we plug $x = 1$ into $f(x)$:  
    $f(1) = \frac{5 - 1}{3(1)} = \frac{4}{3}$
* **Inverse:** If we plug that result ($\frac{4}{3}$) into $f^{-1}(x)$:  
    $f^{-1}(\frac{4}{3}) = \frac{5}{3(\frac{4}{3}) + 1} = \frac{5}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = \mathbf{1}$

The inverse successfully "undid" the original operation and returned us to our starting value.

## 2025-December-26 - Angles and Their Measures :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h14m35s
- Angles are commonly measured using either or **Degrees** or **Radians** :
- For degrees :  
  a full circle measures : $360\degree$   or  
  half circle measures : $180\degree$ 
  One third circle measures : $120\degree$
- For radians:
   a full circle measures : $2 \pi$ radians(two pi radians)  or 
   half circle measures : $\pi$  radians (pi radians)
   One quarter of a circle measures : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (pi over 2 radians)
- To convert between degrees and radians :
  $180\degree$ = $\pi$ radians
### Angle Conversion Examples

To convert between degrees and radians, use the conversion factor:
**$\pi \text{ radians} = 180^\circ$**

---

#### 1. Convert $-135^\circ$ to Radians
To convert degrees to radians, multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$:
$$-135^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{-135\pi}{180}$$
Divide both by 45:
$$= -\frac{3\pi}{4} \text{ radians}$$

#### 2. Convert $\frac{5\pi}{4}$ Radians to Degrees
To convert radians to degrees, multiply by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$:
$$\frac{5\pi}{4} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{5 \times 180^\circ}{4}$$
$$= 5 \times 45^\circ = 225^\circ$$

#### 3. Convert $7$ Radians to Degrees
When $\pi$ is not present in the radian measure, use the decimal value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$:
$$7 \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{1260^\circ}{\pi}$$
$$\approx 401.07^\circ$$

---
#### Conversion Cheat Sheet
* **Degrees $\to$ Radians:** Multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$
* **Radians $\to$ Degrees:** Multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$
### Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS)

When we need to measure angles more precisely than a single degree, we use **DMS** notation. This is similar to how we break down hours into minutes and seconds.

* **Degrees ($^\circ$):** The primary unit of angular measure.
* **Minutes ($'$):** Each degree is divided into **60 minutes**. ($1^\circ = 60'$)
* **Seconds ($''$):** Each minute is divided into **60 seconds**. ($1' = 60''$)

**The Hierarchy:**
$1 \text{ Degree} = 60 \text{ Minutes} = 3,600 \text{ Seconds}$

---

#### Example 1: Convert $32^\circ 17' 25''$ to decimal degrees
To convert to a decimal, we divide each part by its respective power of 60.

1.  **Keep the whole degrees:** $32$
2.  **Convert minutes:** $\frac{17}{60} \approx 0.283333$
3.  **Convert seconds:** $\frac{25}{3600} \approx 0.006944$
4.  **Sum them up:** $32 + 0.283333 + 0.006944 = 32.290277^\circ$

**Result:** $\approx 32.2903^\circ$

---

#### Example 2: Convert $247.3486^\circ$ to DMS
To convert a decimal to DMS, we multiply the fractional parts by 60.

1.  **Extract the degrees:** $247^\circ$
2.  **Find the minutes:** Multiply the remaining decimal by 60.
    * $0.3486 \times 60 = 20.916$
    * The whole number is **$20'$**.
3.  **Find the seconds:** Multiply the new remaining decimal by 60.
    * $0.916 \times 60 = 54.96$
    * The result is approximately **$55''$**.

**Result:** $247^\circ 20' 55''$

## 2025-December-26 - Arclength and Areas of Sectors :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h22m50s
- **Arc** = If you have a circle, a piece of the circumference is called an Arc
- **Sector** = The wedge formed by the arc, is called a sector
- $C = 2\pi r$ : Circumference is 2 pi times the radius
- $A = \pi r^2$ : Area is pi times radius squared
- **$\theta$ (theta)** is the standard Greek letter used to denote the measure of a **central angle** or the **angular position** of a point relative to a fixed reference line.
### Arc Length and Sector Area

In a circle of radius $r$, the length of an arc and the area of a sector are directly proportional to the central angle $\theta$ that subtends them.



---

#### 1. Arc Length ($s$)
The arc length is the distance along the curved part of the circle.

* **When $\theta$ is in Radians:**
  $$s = r\theta$$
  *(This is the simplest form because radians are defined by the ratio of arc length to radius.)*

* **When $\theta$ is in Degrees:**
  $$s = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r$$
  *(This takes the fraction of the total circumference $2\pi r$.)*

---

#### 2. Area of a Sector ($A$)
A sector is a "pie slice" of the circle.

* **When $\theta$ is in Radians:**
  $$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$$

* **When $\theta$ is in Degrees:**
  $$A = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$$
  *(This takes the fraction of the total area $\pi r^2$.)*

---

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Feature               | Formula (Radians)      | Formula (Degrees)                  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Arc Length ($s$)**  | $r\theta$              | $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot 2\pi r$  |
| **Sector Area ($A$)** | $\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$ | $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi r^2$ |

> [!TIP] Conversion Reminder
> If you are given an angle in degrees and want to use the simpler radian formulas, multiply the degrees by $\frac{\pi}{180}$ first!

### Example: Calculating Arclength

**Problem:**
A circular pool has a radius of $8 \text{ meters}$. Find the arclength spanned by a central angle of $2.5 \text{ radians}$.

---

#### 1. Formula
When the central angle $\theta$ is given in **radians**, the formula for arclength ($s$) is:
$$s = r\theta$$

#### 2. Variables
* **Radius ($r$):** $8 \text{ m}$
* **Central Angle ($\theta$):** $2.5 \text{ rad}$

#### 3. Calculation
$$s = 8 \text{ m} \times 2.5 \text{ rad}$$
$$s = 20 \text{ m}$$

**Result:** The arclength is **$20 \text{ meters}$**.

---
> [!TIP] Note on Units
> Since radians are a dimensionless ratio, the final unit of the arclength matches the unit of the radius (meters).
### Example: Calculating Sector Area

**Problem:**
Find the area of a sector of a circle with a radius of $10 \text{ meters}$ that spans an angle of $\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians}$.

---

#### 1. Formula
When the central angle $\theta$ is given in **radians**, the formula for the area of a sector ($A$) is:
$$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$$

#### 2. Variables
* **Radius ($r$):** $10 \text{ m}$
* **Central Angle ($\theta$):** $\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ rad}$

#### 3. Calculation
Substitute the values into the formula:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times (10)^2 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$
$$A = 50 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$

**Simplify the fraction:**
$$A = \frac{25\pi}{3} \text{ m}^2$$

**Decimal Approximation:**
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$:
$$A \approx 26.18 \text{ m}^2$$

**Result:** The area of the sector is **$\frac{25\pi}{3} \text{ m}^2$** (or approximately **$26.18 \text{ m}^2$**).

---
> [!TIP] Units Matter
> Since area is a two-dimensional measure, ensure your final units are squared (meters $\rightarrow$ meters$^2$).
### Area of a Sector Formulas

The area of a sector (a "pie slice" of a circle) depends on the radius ($r$) and the central angle ($\theta$).

---

#### 1. The Formulas
Choose the formula based on the unit of your angle:

| Angle Unit                 | Formula                                 |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Radians**                | $A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta$            |
| **Degrees**                | $A = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$ |
| **Using Arc Length ($s$)** | $A = \frac{1}{2} r s$                   |



---

#### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Identify the Radius ($r$):** The distance from the center to the edge.
2. **Identify the Angle ($\theta$):** Determine if it is in degrees or radians.
3. **Square the Radius:** Calculate $r^2$.
4. **Apply the Formula:** * *If Radians:* Multiply $0.5 \times r^2 \times \theta$.
	* *If Degrees:* Multiply $( \theta / 360 ) \times \pi \times r^2$.

---

#### 3. Worked Example
**Problem:** Find the area of a sector with a radius of $6\text{ cm}$ and a central angle of $60^\circ$.

**Solution (Degree Method):**
$$A = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi \times (6)^2$$
$$A = \frac{1}{6} \times 36\pi$$
$$A = 6\pi \approx 18.85\text{ cm}^2$$
## 2025-December-27 - Linear and Radial Speed :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h28m40s
- **Angular Speed** = $\frac{angle}{time}$ = Spinning Wheel Analogy : Angle it goes through in a unit of time
- **Linear Speed** = $\frac{distance}{time}$ = The speed of a point on the rim of the wheel - The distance a point on rim of wheel travels in a unit of time
### Physics Problem: Circular Motion of a Ferris Wheel

#### Given Data:
* **Radius ($r$):** $20\text{ m}$
* **Time for 1 revolution ($T$):** $2\text{ minutes} = 120\text{ seconds}$

---

#### 1. Angular Speed ($\omega$)
Angular speed is the rate at which the central angle changes. Since one full revolution is $2\pi$ radians:

$$\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

**Calculation:**
$$\omega = \frac{2\pi \text{ rad}}{120 \text{ s}} = \frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s} \approx 0.0524 \text{ rad/s}$$


#### 2. Linear Speed ($v$)
The linear speed (tangential speed) of a point on the rim is related to the angular speed by the formula:

$$v = r\omega$$

**Calculation:**
$$v = 20\text{ m} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s}\right)$$
$$v = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ m/s} \approx 1.047 \text{ m/s}$$

---

#### Summary Table
| Metric            | Formula                   | Result (Exact)                 | Result (Approx)        |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Angular Speed** | $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ | $\frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s}$ | $0.0524 \text{ rad/s}$ |

## 2025-December-27 - Right Angle Trigonometry :

![[Pasted image 20251227181120.png]]
### 2025-December-27 - Right Angle Trigonometry

In a right-angled triangle, we define trigonometric ratios based on the angle $\theta$ and the relationship between the triangle's three sides: the **Opposite** (side across from $\theta$), the **Adjacent** (side next to $\theta$), and the **Hypotenuse** (the longest side).

---

### Primary Trigonometric Ratios (SOH CAH TOA)
* **Sin** ($\sin \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Cos** ($\cos \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Tan** ($\tan \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$

---

### Physics/Math Example: Kite Height

**Given:**
* **Angle of Elevation ($\theta$):** $75^\circ$
* **Hypotenuse ($h$ - length of string):** $100\text{ m}$
* **Target:** Find the **Opposite** side (height of the kite).

---

#### Step 1: Identify the correct ratio
We have the **Hypotenuse** and the **Angle**, and we need the **Opposite** side. Based on **SOH** CAH TOA:

$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$

---

#### Step 2: Set up the equation
$$\sin(75^\circ) = \frac{\text{height}}{100\text{ m}}$$

**Solve for height:**
$$\text{height} = 100 \times \sin(75^\circ)$$

---

#### Step 3: Final Calculation
Using $\sin(75^\circ) \approx 0.9659$:

$$\text{height} \approx 100 \times 0.9659$$
$$\text{height} \approx 96.59\text{ meters}$$

---
**Summary Result:** The kite is flying at a height of approximately **96.59 m**.

### Deriving Trig Ratios for 45° (Hypotenuse = 1)

To find the exact values of $\sin(45^\circ)$ and $\cos(45^\circ)$ without a calculator, we use the properties of an **Isosceles Right Triangle** (also known as a 45-45-90 triangle).

#### 1. Geometry of the Triangle
In a triangle where two angles are $45^\circ$, the sides opposite those angles must be equal. 
* Let the two legs (Opposite and Adjacent) be $x$.
* The Hypotenuse is given as $1$.

#### 2. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem
We use $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ to solve for $x$:

$$x^2 + x^2 = 1^2$$
$$2x^2 = 1$$
$$x^2 = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

#### 3. Rationalizing the Denominator
To simplify $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we multiply the top and bottom by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$x = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

#### 4. Calculating the Ratios
Now we apply the definitions of Sine and Cosine:

* **Sin(45°)** = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* **Cos(45°)** = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

---
**Summary:**
* $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
### Special Right Triangle: 45-45-90 (Hypotenuse = 5)

To find the trigonometric ratios for $45^\circ$ without a calculator, we use an **Isosceles Right Triangle**. Because two angles are $45^\circ$, the sides opposite them (the legs) must be equal in length.

#### 1. Solving for the Legs
Let both the **Opposite** and **Adjacent** sides be represented by $x$. The hypotenuse is given as $5$.



Using the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$):
$$x^2 + x^2 = 5^2$$
$$2x^2 = 25$$
$$x^2 = \frac{25}{2}$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{25}{2}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}$$

To rationalize the denominator:
$$x = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

#### 2. Calculating the Ratios
Now, we apply the definitions of Sine, Cosine, and Tangent (SOH CAH TOA):

* **$\sin(45^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cos(45^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\tan(45^\circ)$** (Opposite / Adjacent):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5\sqrt{2}/2} = 1$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$
### Special Right Triangle: 30-60-90 (Hypotenuse = 1)

To find the exact values for $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ without a calculator, we use the properties of a **30-60-90 triangle**. This triangle is essentially half of an equilateral triangle.

#### 1. Geometry of the Triangle
* Start with an equilateral triangle where all sides are $1$. 
* Bisect it down the middle to create two right triangles.
* In these right triangles:
    * The **Hypotenuse** stays $1$.
    * The **Short Leg** (opposite the $30^\circ$ angle) becomes exactly half of the original side: $\frac{1}{2}$.


#### 2. Solving for the Long Leg
We use the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) where $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $c = 1$:

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + b^2 = 1^2$$
$$\frac{1}{4} + b^2 = 1$$
$$b^2 = \frac{3}{4}$$
$$b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

#### 3. Calculating the Ratios
Using the triangle where the **Opposite** side to $30^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, the **Adjacent** side is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and the **Hypotenuse** is $1$:

* **$\sin(30^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}$$

* **$\cos(30^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$ (or $\frac{1}{2}$)
* $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
### Special Right Triangle: Finding 60° Ratios

To find the exact values for $60^\circ$ without a calculator, we use the same **30-60-90 triangle** derived from an equilateral triangle with sides of length $1$.

#### Geometry of the 60° Angle
In this triangle, when we focus on the $60^\circ$ angle:
* The **Opposite** side is the altitude: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* The **Adjacent** side is the base: $\frac{1}{2}$.
* The **Hypotenuse** remains: $1$.



#### Calculating the Ratios
Using the definitions of Sine and Cosine (SOH CAH TOA):

* **$\sin(60^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

* **$\cos(60^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$

- - $sin\theta = sin(\theta - 2\pi)$ = $sin(\theta - 360\degree)$  : also works for subtracting $360\degree$ - same as above
### Properties of Trigonometric Functions & Periodicity

Trigonometric functions are **periodic**, meaning their values repeat at regular intervals. This behavior is best understood by observing a point $(x, y)$ moving around the **Unit Circle** (a circle with radius $r = 1$).

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definitions
On the unit circle, any angle $\theta$ corresponds to a point $(x, y)$. Since $r=1$, the standard trig ratios simplify to:
* **$\cos(\theta) = x$**
* **$\sin(\theta) = y$**
* **$\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$** (where $x \neq 0$)

#### 2. Periodic Property
As you rotate around the circle, once you complete a full revolution ($360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians), you land back on the exact same $(x, y)$ coordinates. This creates the periodic nature of the functions.

##### Sine and Cosine Period ($2\pi$)
The values of Sine and Cosine repeat every $2\pi$ radians.
* $\sin(\theta + 2\pi n) = \sin(\theta)$
* $\cos(\theta + 2\pi n) = \cos(\theta)$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

##### Tangent and Cotangent Period ($\pi$)
The Tangent function repeats more frequently, every half-rotation, because the ratio of $y/x$ returns to the same value in opposite quadrants (e.g., both $x$ and $y$ are negative in Quadrant III, making the ratio positive again).
* $\tan(\theta + \pi n) = \tan(\theta)$
#### 3. Domain and Range
| Function           | Domain                                  | Range               |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **$\sin(\theta)$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$                     | $[-1, 1]$           |
| **$\cos(\theta)$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$                     | $[-1, 1]$           |
| **$\tan(\theta)$** | All $\theta \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n$ | $(-\infty, \infty)$ |

#### 4. Even and Odd Properties
* **Cosine is Even:** Symmetric about the y-axis. $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
* **Sine is Odd:** Symmetric about the origin. $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
* **Tangent is Odd:** Symmetric about the origin. $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
### Even and Odd Properties of Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions exhibit symmetry properties based on whether they are **even** or **odd**. These properties allow us to simplify expressions involving negative angles by relating them back to their positive counterparts.

#### 1. Even Functions: Cosine and Secant
A function is **even** if its graph is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. Algebraically, this means $f(-\theta) = f(\theta)$.

When you rotate an angle $-\theta$ (clockwise), the $x$-coordinate (Cosine) remains exactly the same as it would for the positive angle $\theta$ (counter-clockwise).

* **Cosine Property:** $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
* **Secant Property:** $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$

#### 2. Odd Functions: Sine, Tangent, Cosecant, and Cotangent
A function is **odd** if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. Algebraically, this means $f(-\theta) = -f(\theta)$.

When you rotate an angle $-\theta$, the $y$-coordinate (Sine) becomes the negative of the $y$-coordinate for the positive angle $\theta$. 

**Why Tangent is Odd:**
Since $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$, substituting a negative angle gives:
$$\tan(-\theta) = \frac{\sin(-\theta)}{\cos(-\theta)} = \frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = -\tan(\theta)$$
Because the numerator (Sine) changes sign but the denominator (Cosine) does not, the entire Tangent ratio becomes negative.

* **Sine Property:** $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
* **Cosecant Property:** $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$
* **Tangent Property:** $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
* **Cotangent Property:** $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$

#### 3. Summary Table
| Function Type | Basic Identity            | Symmetry                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| **Even**      | $f(-\theta) = f(\theta)$  | Symmetric about **y-axis** |
| **Odd**       | $f(-\theta) = -f(\theta)$ | Symmetric about **origin** |

**Example Calculation:**
* If $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$, then $\cos(-60^\circ) = 0.5$.
* If $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$, then $\sin(-30^\circ) = -0.5$.
* If $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$, then $\tan(-45^\circ) = -1$.
### Pythagorean Identity & Trig Properties

The Pythagorean Identity is the most fundamental relationship in trigonometry. It bridges the gap between the geometry of a right triangle and the algebraic properties of the Unit Circle.

#### 1. Derivation from the Unit Circle
In a coordinate plane, any point on a circle with radius $r$ centered at the origin follows the equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. On the **Unit Circle**, where the radius $r = 1$:

* The $x$-coordinate is defined as $\cos(\theta)$.
* The $y$-coordinate is defined as $\sin(\theta)$.

Substituting these into the circle equation gives the primary identity:
$$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$$

#### 2. Visualizing the Identity
If you draw a right triangle inside the unit circle:
* The **Horizontal leg** (adjacent) has length $\cos(\theta)$.
* The **Vertical leg** (opposite) has length $\sin(\theta)$.
* The **Hypotenuse** is the radius, which is $1$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$):
$$(\cos \theta)^2 + (\sin \theta)^2 = 1^2$$

#### 3. Related Pythagorean Identities
By dividing the primary identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$) by either $\cos^2 \theta$ or $\sin^2 \theta$, we derive two other essential forms:

##### The Tangent-Secant Identity
Divide everything by $\cos^2(\theta)$:
$$\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} \implies \tan^2(\theta) + 1 = \sec^2(\theta)$$

##### The Cotangent-Cosecant Identity
Divide everything by $\sin^2(\theta)$:
$$\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \implies 1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)$$

#### 4. Practical Uses
* **Finding Unknown Ratios:** If you know $\sin(\theta)$ and which quadrant the angle is in, you can solve for $\cos(\theta)$ without needing the angle itself.
* **Simplifying Expressions:** In Calculus and Pre-Calculus proofs, seeing $1 - \sin^2(\theta)$ allows you to instantly replace it with $\cos^2(\theta)$.

---
**Summary of Identity Forms:**
1. $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$
2. $\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$
3. $1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$
### Evaluating Trig Functions Using Periodicity

To evaluate trigonometric functions with large or negative angles, we use the **periodic property**. This involves adding or subtracting full rotations ($360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians) until the angle is within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range.

#### 1. Evaluating $\cos(5\pi)$
The cosine function has a period of $2\pi$. This means we can subtract $2\pi$ repeatedly without changing the result.



**Step-by-step:**
* $5\pi - 2\pi = 3\pi$
* $3\pi - 2\pi = 1\pi$

Now we evaluate at $\pi$ ($180^\circ$):
* On the unit circle, the coordinates at $\pi$ are $(-1, 0)$.
* Since $\cos(\theta) = x$:
$$\cos(5\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1$$

#### 2. Evaluating $\sin(-420^\circ)$
For negative angles, we rotate clockwise. To find the **coterminal angle** (the positive version of the same spot), we add $360^\circ$ until the angle is positive.

**Step-by-step:**
* $-420^\circ + 360^\circ = -60^\circ$
* $-60^\circ + 360^\circ = 300^\circ$

Now we evaluate at $300^\circ$ (which is in Quadrant IV):
* The reference angle is $60^\circ$ ($360^\circ - 300^\circ = 60^\circ$).
* In Quadrant IV, **Sine is negative**.
* From our special angles: $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Therefore:
$$\sin(-420^\circ) = -\sin(60^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

---
**Summary of Results:**
* $\cos(5\pi) = -1$
* $\sin(-420^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

- **Midline** = Horizontal Line halfway in between the maximum and minimum points (y=0)
- **Amplitude** = is the vertical distance between a maxpoint and the midline
- **Period** = Is the horizontal length of the smallest repeating unit
### Graphs of Sine and Cosine Functions

Both the Sine and Cosine functions create wave-like patterns called **sinusoids**. While they share the same shape, they differ in where they start relative to the $y$-axis.

#### 1. Fundamental Characteristics
These properties apply to the parent functions $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(x)$.

* **Domain:** $(-\infty, \infty)$ — You can plug in any angle.
* **Range:** $[-1, 1]$ — The wave never goes above $1$ or below $-1$.
* **Period:** $2\pi$ — The graph completes one full cycle every $2\pi$ units.
* **Amplitude:** $1$ — The distance from the center (midline) to the peak.

#### 2. Key Differences
The main difference is a **phase shift** of $\pi/2$ ($90^\circ$).

| Feature        | $y = \sin(x)$                       | $y = \cos(x)$                        |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **At $x=0$**   | Starts at **$0$** (Midline)         | Starts at **$1$** (Maximum)          |
| **Symmetry**   | **Odd** (Origin symmetry)           | **Even** (y-axis symmetry)           |
| **Intercepts** | Intersects x-axis at $0, \pi, 2\pi$ | Intersects x-axis at $\pi/2, 3\pi/2$ |

#### 3. General Sinusoidal Equation
For more complex waves, we use the transformation formula:
$$y = A \sin(B(x - C)) + D \quad \text{or} \quad y = A \cos(B(x - C)) + D$$

* **$|A|$ (Amplitude):** Vertical stretch/shrink.
* **$B$ (Frequency factor):** Used to find the **Period** ($P = \frac{2\pi}{|B|}$).
* **$C$ (Phase Shift):** Horizontal shift (right if $C > 0$, left if $C < 0$).
* **$D$ (Vertical Shift):** Moves the **Midline** up or down.

#### 4. Five Key Points Method
To sketch one full period accurately, find these five points:
1. **Start:** $(C, \text{starting value})$
2. **Quarter-way:** $(\text{start} + \frac{P}{4})$
3. **Half-way:** $(\text{start} + \frac{P}{2})$
4. **Three-quarters:** $(\text{start} + \frac{3P}{4})$
5. **End:** $(\text{start} + P)$

### Graphs of Sinusoidal Functions

Sinusoidal functions are functions that are related to **Sine** and **Cosine** through various transformations. These transformations allow us to describe wave-like behaviors in a variety of real-world contexts.

#### 1. The General Equation
Any sinusoidal function can be written in the following general form:
$$y = a \sin(b(x - h)) + k \quad \text{or} \quad y = a \cos(b(x - h)) + k$$

#### 2. Key Transformation Properties
Each variable in the general equation corresponds to a specific geometric transformation:

* **Amplitude ($|a|$):** * Determines the "height" of the wave from the center.
    * The range of the function is $[k - |a|, k + |a|]$.
    * If $a < 0$, the graph is reflected across the horizontal midline.
* **Period ($P$):** * The horizontal length of one full cycle. 
    * Formula: $P = \frac{2\pi}{|b|}$ (for both $\sin$ and $\cos$).
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** * The horizontal translation (shift) of the graph.
    * If $h$ is positive, the graph shifts **Right**.
    * If $h$ is negative, the graph shifts **Left**.
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** * Determines the **Midline** (the horizontal center of the wave).
    * The entire graph moves up or down by $k$ units.

#### 3. Summary of Graphing Steps
To graph a sinusoidal function manually without a calculator:
1.  **Identify the Midline ($y = k$):** Draw this horizontal line first.
2.  **Determine the Peaks and Valleys:** Use the amplitude to find the max ($k+a$) and min ($k-a$).
3.  **Find the Period:** Calculate $2\pi/b$ to know how wide one cycle is.
4.  **Apply Phase Shift:** Start your cycle at $x = h$ instead of $x = 0$.
5.  **Plot 5 Key Points:** * Start, Quarter-point, Midpoint, Three-quarter point, and End.
    * For **Sine**, these are: *Midline → Max → Midline → Min → Midline*.
    * For **Cosine**, these are: *Max → Midline → Min → Midline → Max*.

### Graphs of Tan, Sec, Cot, and Csc Functions

Unlike Sine and Cosine, which are smooth, continuous waves, the other four trigonometric functions feature **vertical asymptotes** and discontinuities. This is because they are defined as ratios that can have a zero in the denominator.

#### 1. Tangent ($y = \tan x$) and Cotangent ($y = \cot x$)
These functions represent the ratio of sides and have a unique period.

* **Period:** $\pi$ (half the period of Sine/Cosine).
* **Vertical Asymptotes:**
    * **$\tan x$:** Occur where $\cos x = 0$ (e.g., $x = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}$).
    * **$\cot x$:** Occur where $\sin x = 0$ (e.g., $x = 0, \pi, 2\pi$).
* **Key Points:**
    * **$\tan x$** passes through $(0,0)$ and increases between asymptotes.
    * **$\cot x$** decreases between asymptotes and is zero at $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

#### 2. Cosecant ($y = \csc x$) and Secant ($y = \sec x$)
These are the reciprocal functions and are best graphed by first sketching their partner functions (Sine and Cosine).

* **Period:** $2\pi$ (same as Sine/Cosine).
* **Relationship to Sine/Cosine:**
    * The **Vertical Asymptotes** of the reciprocal function occur at the **x-intercepts** of the original function.
    * The **Relative Maxima/Minima** (peaks and valleys) of the reciprocal function touch the peaks and valleys of the original Sine/Cosine wave.
* **Visualizing the Graph:**
    * Where Sine is at its peak ($1$), Cosecant is also at $1$ and then curves upward toward infinity.
    * The graph looks like a series of alternating "U-shaped" curves that never cross the midline.

| **$\cot x$** | $\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$ | $x = n\pi$                 | $(-\infty, \infty)$              |
| **$\sec x$** | $\frac{1}{\cos x}$      | $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$ | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ |
| **$\csc x$** | $\frac{1}{\sin x}$      | $x = n\pi$                 | $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty)$ |

#### 4. Pro-Tip for Graphing
When graphing $\sec x$ or $\csc x$, always lightly pencil in the corresponding $\cos x$ or $\sin x$ wave first. The reciprocal "U" shapes will sit right on top of the peaks and valleys, and your asymptotes will go straight through the points where the wave hits the midline.

### Graphs of Transformations: Tan, Sec, Cot, and Csc

Transforming these functions involves the same principles as Sine and Cosine ($y = a \cdot f(b(x - h)) + k$), but with a few critical differences in how the period and vertical stretch are handled.

#### 1. Transforming Period ($b$)
The horizontal stretch or compression depends on the base period of the function.
* **Tangent and Cotangent:** The base period is $\pi$.
    * **New Period** $P = \frac{\pi}{|b|}$
* **Secant and Cosecant:** The base period is $2\pi$.
    * **New Period** $P = \frac{2\pi}{|b|}$

#### 2. Transforming Phase Shift ($h$) and Vertical Shift ($k$)
* **Phase Shift ($h$):** Moves the entire graph (including vertical asymptotes) left or right.
    * Shift is **Right** if $h > 0$.
    * Shift is **Left** if $h < 0$.
* **Vertical Shift ($k$):** Moves the graph up or down.
    * For **Tan/Cot**, this moves the center point (the "inflection-like" point).
    * For **Sec/Csc**, this moves the midline that the corresponding Sine/Cosine wave would oscillate around.

#### 3. Transforming Amplitude/Vertical Stretch ($a$)
While we don't call it "amplitude" for these functions (since they go to infinity), $|a|$ still acts as a vertical stretch factor.
* **Tangent/Cotangent:** $|a|$ tells you the y-coordinate of the points halfway between the center and the asymptotes.
* **Secant/Cosecant:** $|a|$ determines the distance from the midline to the vertices of the U-shaped curves.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Graphing Technique
1.  **Find the Asymptotes:**
    * For $y = \tan(bx)$, the first two asymptotes are found by solving $bx = -\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $bx = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
    * For $y = \cot(bx)$, the first two are at $bx = 0$ and $bx = \pi$.
2.  **Apply Shifts:** Move those asymptotes horizontally by $h$.
3.  **Plot the Center Point:** For Tan, this is exactly halfway between the asymptotes at the height of the vertical shift $k$.
4.  **Use $|a|$ for Shape:** Move one-quarter of a period to the left and right of the center point to plot points at heights $k - a$ and $k + a$.
5.  **Reciprocal Strategy:** For Sec/Csc, transform the parent Sine or Cosine graph first, then draw the U-curves touching the transformed peaks and valleys.

- $y=csc(x)$ = $\frac{1}{sin(x)}$: standard graph of cosecant
- $y=2csc(\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}) + 1$ : the '2' adds a vertical stretch by 2, the '+ 1' shifts up by 1, the '$\pi x$' says that everything shrinks by $\frac{1}{\pi}$, the '$\frac{\pi}{2}$' creates a horizontal shift by 1/2 to the left
### Graphs of Trigonometric Transformations

For the functions $y = A \tan(Bx - C) + D$ and $y = A \sec(Bx - C) + D$, the constants $A, B, C$, and $D$ affect the graphs as follows:

* **Vertical Stretch/Compression ($A$):** The constant $|A|$ determines the vertical stretch or compression of the graph; for tangent, it affects the steepness, and for secant, it determines the distance from the midline to the vertices of the curves.
* **Period ($B$):** The constant $B$ affects the period of the function, with the new period being $P = \frac{\pi}{|B|}$ for tangent and $P = \frac{2\pi}{|B|}$ for secant.
* **Phase Shift ($C$):** The ratio $\frac{C}{B}$ determines the horizontal phase shift, moving the entire graph (including asymptotes) to the right if the result is positive and to the left if it is negative.
* **Vertical Shift ($D$):** The constant $D$ represents the vertical shift, moving the entire graph up or down and establishing a new midline or center point for the function.

### Introduction to Trig Identities Practice

The following questions explore the difference between conditional equations and identities based on the provided image.

#### Example: Find solutions to the following equations:

**a) $x^2 - 6x = 7$**

**Solution:**
* **Set equation to zero:** $x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0$
* **Factor:** $(x - 7)(x + 1) = 0$
* **Solve for x:** * $x - 7 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 7$
	* $x + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -1$

### Introduction to Trig Identities: Practice Problems

The following exercises determine whether specific trigonometric equations are identities.

#### Example: Decide which of the following equations are identities.

**a) $\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)$**
* **Analysis**: This is **NOT an identity**.
* **Reasoning**: While it may look similar to a known formula, testing a value like $x = \pi/4$ shows $\sin(2 \cdot \pi/4) = \sin(\pi/2) = 1$, whereas $2\sin(\pi/4) = 2(\sqrt{2}/2) = \sqrt{2}$. Since $1 \neq \sqrt{2}$, it is a conditional equation.

---

**b) $\cos(\theta + \pi) = -\cos(\theta)$**
* **Analysis**: This **IS an identity**.
* **Reasoning**: This is a horizontal shift property. Adding $\pi$ to the argument of a cosine function results in a phase shift that perfectly reflects the graph across the x-axis, making the equality true for all values of $\theta$.

---

**c) $\sec(x) - \sin(x)\tan(x) = \cos(x)$**
* **Analysis**: This **IS an identity**.
* **Verification**: 
	1. Rewrite in terms of sine and cosine: $\frac{1}{\cos(x)} - \sin(x)\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right) = \cos(x)$
	2. Combine terms: $\frac{1 - \sin^2(x)}{\cos(x)} = \cos(x)$
	3. Use Pythagorean Identity ($1 - \sin^2(x) = \cos^2(x)$): $\frac{\cos^2(x)}{\cos(x)} = \cos(x)$
	4. Simplify: $\cos(x) = \cos(x)$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=3h13m20s
### Pythagorean Identities Summary

The Pythagorean Identities are fundamental relationships in trigonometry derived from the Pythagorean Theorem applied to the unit circle.

#### 1. The Fundamental Identity
The primary identity is based on the unit circle equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, where $r=1$, $x=\cos(\theta)$, and $y=\sin(\theta)$:
* **$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$**

#### 2. Derived Identities
By dividing the fundamental identity by either $\cos^2(\theta)$ or $\sin^2(\theta)$, we obtain two additional forms:

* **Tangent-Secant Identity**: Obtained by dividing all terms by $\cos^2(\theta)$.
	* **$\tan^2(\theta) + 1 = \sec^2(\theta)$**
* **Cotangent-Cosecant Identity**: Obtained by dividing all terms by $\sin^2(\theta)$.
	* **$1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)$** (often written as $\cot^2(\theta) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta)$)
