## 2025-December-24 - Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=20
- Definition. A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and out-put numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value).
- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation. : $y = x^2 + 1$, which can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ : 
- $f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ 
- $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$
- $f(a+3) = a^2 + 6a + 10$ 
- not even 2 minutes into the video and she is already talking about 'functions' as 'mothers' and how you can have infinite mothers.. - Do I really want to listen to this for 5 and a half hours?
- Sometimes a function is described as a graph instead of an equation
- Definition. The **domain** of a function is all possible **x-values.**  
- The **range** is the **y-values**.
- To find domain of a function, exclude 'x' values that make the denominator '0'. Also exclude 'x' values that make an expression inside a square root negative
## 2025-December-24 - Increasing and Decreasing Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=12m05s
- green line go up = positive = inceasing
- blue line go down = negative = decreasing
## 2025-December-24 - Maximums and Minimums on a Graphs :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=17m35s
- **Maximum** A function f(x) has an absolute maximum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as big as it ever gets
- **Minimum** A function f(x) has an absolute minimum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as small as it ever gets
- **Global Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another word for absolute maximum/minimum values
- **Local Maximum** = If it is larger than any nearby y values
- **Local Minimum** = If it is smaller than any nearby y values
- **Relative Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another name for local minimum/maximum values
## 2025-December-24 - Even and Odd Functions :

- A graph is symmetric in respect to the x axis, y axis, origin if... Not typing all that out, and describing each graph.
- **Symmetric X Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with X axis (x,y) is mirrored by the same points on (x, -y)
- **Symmetric Y Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with Y axis (x,y) is mirroed on the same point with (-x, y)
- **Symmetric Origin** = Mirror Symmetry with origin (0,0) - it has $180\degree$ degree rotational symmetry -  is mirrored by inverting it upside down and should look exactly the same, (x,y) = (-x,-y)
- **Even/Odd Functions** = Used to describe functions which graphs have certain kinds of symmetry
- **Even Function** = A graph is even if it's graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis : (x, f(x)) is mirrored by (-x, f(-x)) : aka f(-x) = f(x) for all x values in it's domain, aka same height at 'x' and '-x'
- **Odd Function** = A graph is odd if it's graph is symmetric with respect to it's origin : (x, y) is mirrored by (-x, -y) : aka f(-x) = -f(x)
- There's no word for functions that are symmetric to the x axis - because if it is symmetric with the x-axis, it's not a function (won't pass the vertical line test)
## 2025-December-25 - Toolkit Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=36m15s
- $y = x$ : creates a line
- $y = x^2$ : creates a parabola
- $y = x^3$ : creates a cubic odd function
- $y = \sqrt{x}$ : creates a square root function
- $y = |x|$ : creates a 'V'
- $y = 2^x$ : creates an exponential function
- $y = \frac{1}{x}$ : creates a hyperobla odd function
- $y = \frac{1}{x^2}$ : creates an even function asymptote
- You should memorize what each function looks like for future Sean
## 2025-December-26 - Transformations of Functions : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=43m20s
- If you change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function transforms.
- $y=\sqrt{x} - 2$ : moves the graph down 2 on the y axis 
- $y= \sqrt{x-2}$ : moves the graph right (counterintuitive) on the x axis - since the equation now has to add 2 units to the graph, to get it to the right original positioning, it moves it right. 
- Rules for transformations: 
  - Numbers on the outside of the function affect the y-values and result in vertical motions. These motions are in the direction you expect.
- Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x-values and result in horizontal motions. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect.
- Adding results in a shift (translations)
- Multiplying results in a stretch or shrink
-  A negative sign results in a reflection
- $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$ : The multiplier will also be inverted, this will actually **stretch** (counterintuitive, not shrink) the graph on the horizontal axis - a vertical shrink of one half$y = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x}$ is the same as a horizontal stretch of $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$
## 2025-December-26 - Piecewirse Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=55m50s
- A **Piecewise Function** = is a function which is defined in pieces. : 
  f(x) = 
  '$-x^2$ if $x<1$'
   '$-2x+3$ if $x \ge 1$' 
- If a piecewise function is **continuous** if one piece connects directly to another piece, if there is a jump on the points of the function, it is **not continuous, discontinuitous**
