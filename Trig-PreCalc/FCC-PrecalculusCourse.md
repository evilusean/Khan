- Definition. A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and out-put numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value).
- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation. : $y = x^2 + 1$, which can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ : 
- $f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ 
- $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$
- $f(a+3) = a^2 + 6a + 10$ 
- not even 2 minutes into the video and she is already talking about 'functions' as 'mothers' and how you can have infinite mothers.. - Do I really want to listen to this for 5 and a half hours?
- Sometimes a function is described as a graph instead of an equation
- Definition. The **domain** of a function is all possible **x-values.**  
- The **range** is the **y-values**.
- To find domain of a function, exclude 'x' values that make the denominator '0'. Also exclude 'x' values that make an expression inside a square root negative
