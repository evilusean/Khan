## 2025-December-24 - Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=20
- Definition. A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and out-put numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value).
- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation. : $y = x^2 + 1$, which can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ : 
- $f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ 
- $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$
- $f(a+3) = a^2 + 6a + 10$ 
- not even 2 minutes into the video and she is already talking about 'functions' as 'mothers' and how you can have infinite mothers.. - Do I really want to listen to this for 5 and a half hours?
- Sometimes a function is described as a graph instead of an equation
- Definition. The **domain** of a function is all possible **x-values.**  
- The **range** is the **y-values**.
- To find domain of a function, exclude 'x' values that make the denominator '0'. Also exclude 'x' values that make an expression inside a square root negative
## 2025-December-24 - Increasing and Decreasing Functions :

- green line go up = positive = inceasing
- blue line go down = negative = decreasing
## 2025-December-24 - Maximums and Minimums on a Graphs :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=17m35s
- **Maximum** A function f(x) has an absolute maximum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as big as it ever gets
- **Minimum** A function f(x) has an absolute minimum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as small as it ever gets
- **Global Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another word for absolute maximum/minimum values
- **Local Maximum** = If it is larger than any nearby y values
- **Local Minimum** = If it is smaller than any nearby y values
- **Relative Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another name for local minimum/maximum values
