## 2025-December-24 - Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=20
- Definition. A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and out-put numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value).
- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation. : $y = x^2 + 1$, which can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ : 
- $f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ 
- $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$
- $f(a+3) = a^2 + 6a + 10$ 
- not even 2 minutes into the video and she is already talking about 'functions' as 'mothers' and how you can have infinite mothers.. - Do I really want to listen to this for 5 and a half hours?
- Sometimes a function is described as a graph instead of an equation
- 
- Definition. The **domain** of a function is all possible **x-values.**  
- The **range** is the **y-values**.
- To find domain of a function, exclude 'x' values that make the denominator '0'. Also exclude 'x' values that make an expression inside a square root negative
## 2025-December-24 - Increasing and Decreasing Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=12m05s
- green line go up = positive = inceasing
- blue line go down = negative = decreasing
## 2025-December-24 - Maximums and Minimums on a Graphs :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=17m35s
- **Maximum** A function f(x) has an absolute maximum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as big as it ever gets
- **Minimum** A function f(x) has an absolute minimum at x = c if the 'y' value at 'x = c' is as small as it ever gets
- **Global Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another word for absolute maximum/minimum values
- **Local Maximum** = If it is larger than any nearby y values
- **Local Minimum** = If it is smaller than any nearby y values
- **Relative Maximum/Minimum Values** = Another name for local minimum/maximum values
## 2025-December-24 - Even and Odd Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=26m40s
![[Pasted image 20251224163701.png]]
- A graph is symmetric in respect to the x axis, y axis, origin if... Not typing all that out, and describing each graph.
- **Symmetric X Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with X axis (x,y) is mirrored by the same points on (x, -y)
- **Symmetric Y Axis** = Mirror Symmetry with Y axis (x,y) is mirroed on the same point with (-x, y)
- **Symmetric Origin** = Mirror Symmetry with origin (0,0) - it has $180\degree$ degree rotational symmetry -  is mirrored by inverting it upside down and should look exactly the same, (x,y) = (-x,-y)
- **Even/Odd Functions** = Used to describe functions which graphs have certain kinds of symmetry
- **Even Function** = A graph is even if it's graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis : (x, f(x)) is mirrored by (-x, f(-x)) : aka f(-x) = f(x) for all x values in it's domain, aka same height at 'x' and '-x'
- **Odd Function** = A graph is odd if it's graph is symmetric with respect to it's origin : (x, y) is mirrored by (-x, -y) : aka f(-x) = -f(x)
- There's no word for functions that are symmetric to the x axis - because if it is symmetric with the x-axis, it's not a function (won't pass the vertical line test)
## 2025-December-25 - Toolkit Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=36m15s
- $y = x$ : creates a line
- $y = x^2$ : creates a parabola
- $y = x^3$ : creates a cubic odd function
- $y = \sqrt{x}$ : creates a square root function
- $y = |x|$ : creates a 'V'
- $y = 2^x$ : creates an exponential function
- $y = \frac{1}{x}$ : creates a hyperobla odd function
- $y = \frac{1}{x^2}$ : creates an even function asymptote
- You should memorize what each function looks like for future Sean
## 2025-December-26 - Transformations of Functions : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=43m20s
- If you change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function transforms.
- $y=\sqrt{x} - 2$ : moves the graph down 2 on the y axis 
- $y= \sqrt{x-2}$ : moves the graph right (counterintuitive) on the x axis - since the equation now has to add 2 units to the graph, to get it to the right original positioning, it moves it right. 
- Rules for transformations: 
  - Numbers on the outside of the function affect the y-values and result in vertical motions. These motions are in the direction you expect.
- Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x-values and result in horizontal motions. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect.
- Adding results in a shift (translations)
- Multiplying results in a stretch or shrink
-  A negative sign results in a reflection
- $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$ : The multiplier will also be inverted, this will actually **stretch** (counterintuitive, not shrink) the graph on the horizontal axis - a vertical shrink of one half$y = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x}$ is the same as a horizontal stretch of $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x}$
## 2025-December-26 - Piecewise Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=55m50s
- A **Piecewise Function** = is a function which is defined in pieces. : 
  f(x) = 
  '$-x^2$ if $x<1$'
   '$-2x+3$ if $x \ge 1$' 
- If a piecewise function is **continuous** if one piece connects directly to another piece, if there is a jump on the points of the function, it is **not continuous, discontinuous**
## 2025-December-27 - Inverse Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h20s
- **Inverse Function** = Undoes what a function does. : 
  $f(x) = x+2$ 
  $f^{-1}(x)=x -2$ 
- Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
- This is the mathematical way of saying that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ undo each other.
   $f^{-1} \circ f(x) = x$ 
  $f \circ f^{-1}(x) = x$ . 
- $\circ$ = **Function Composition Symbol** = Function composition is the process of combining two functions into a single new function by using the **output** of the first (inner) function as the **input** for the second (outer) function.
- Not all functions have an inverse function : They must be a 1 to 1 function, also, exponential functions will not work : $f(x) = x^2$ can be positive or negative - Only a function that satisfies the *horizontal line test* has an inverse function **One To One Functions** have an inverse function
### Inverse $\neq$ Reciprocal

It is a common mistake to think $f^{-1}(x)$ means the same thing as $\frac{1}{f(x)}$. While they use similar notation, they represent entirely different mathematical concepts.

---

#### The Core Difference
| Concept        | Notation                          | Meaning                    | Goal                                  |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Inverse**    | $f^{-1}(x)$                       | **Reverse Mapping**        | To "undo" the action of the function. |
| **Reciprocal** | $[f(x)]^{-1}$ or $\frac{1}{f(x)}$ | **Multiplicative Inverse** | To flip the output into a fraction.   |

---

#### Numerical Comparison
Let's use a simple function $f(x) = 2x$ with an input of $x = 3$.
* **Original Output:** $f(3) = 6$

**The Inverse ($f^{-1}$)**
The inverse "reverses" $2x$ to $\frac{x}{2}$.
$$f^{-1}(6) = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$
*Result: We returned to the original input.*

**The Reciprocal ($\frac{1}{f}$)**
The reciprocal simply flips the result ($6$).
$$\frac{1}{f(3)} = \frac{1}{6}$$
*Result: We just get a fraction.*

---

> [!TIP]
> To keep your notes clear, always think: **Inverse** = "Go Backwards", **Reciprocal** = "Flip Upside Down".
### The Domain-Range Swap

When you create an inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$, you are fundamentally reversing the direction of the mapping. This results in a total swap of the Domain and Range.

---

#### The Swap Rule
Because an inverse function "undoes" the original, the inputs and outputs switch roles:
* **$\text{Domain of } f$** $\rightarrow$ **$\text{Range of } f^{-1}$**
* **$\text{Range of } f$** $\rightarrow$ **$\text{Domain of } f^{-1}$**

#### Why It Happens
1. **Algebraically:** To find $f^{-1}(x)$, we replace $f(x)$ with $y$, then literally **swap $x$ and $y$**. Since $x$ is the domain and $y$ is the range, the swap is built into the math.
2. **Graphically:** Every point $(a, b)$ on the graph of $f$ becomes the point $(b, a)$ on the graph of $f^{-1}$. This creates a reflection over the line $y = x$.

---

#### Case Study: $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$
Let's see how the boundaries move:

| Feature      | Original $f(x)$ | Inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ |
| :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| **Equation** | $\sqrt{x-2}$    | $x^2 + 2$           |
| **Domain**   | $[2, \infty)$   | $[0, \infty)$       |
| **Range**    | $[0, \infty)$   | $[2, \infty)$       |

> [!WARNING] Restriction Requirement
> Notice that the **Range** of the original function ($[0, \infty)$) dictates the **Domain** of the inverse. Even though $x^2+2$ usually accepts any number, as an inverse of $\sqrt{x-2}$, its domain must be restricted to $x \ge 0$.
### Graphical Reflection: $y = x$

The most distinct visual characteristic of an inverse function is its symmetry. If you plot both $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ on the same coordinate plane, the graph of the inverse is a **reflection** of the original graph across the identity line $y = x$.

---

#### 1. The Geometry of the Reflection
Because the inverse function is created by swapping every $x$-coordinate with every $y$-coordinate, the physical position of every point $(a, b)$ on the original curve moves to $(b, a)$ for the inverse.

* **The Reflection Line:** $y = x$ acts as a "mirror."
* **Point Transformation:** * If $f(x)$ passes through $(2, 5)$, then $f^{-1}(x)$ must pass through $(5, 2)$.
	* If $f(x)$ passes through $(-1, 4)$, then $f^{-1}(x)$ must pass through $(4, -1)$.

---

#### 2. Visualizing the Symmetry
Imagine folding your graph paper along the diagonal line $y = x$. The curve of the original function would land exactly on top of the curve of the inverse function.

* **Intersections:** If the original function $f(x)$ ever crosses the line $y = x$, the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ will cross at that exact same point (since swapping $x$ and $y$ when they are equal changes nothing).
* **Perpendicularity:** The line segment connecting a point $(a, b)$ to its reflected point $(b, a)$ is always perpendicular to the line $y = x$.

---

#### 3. Why This Matters for "One-to-One" Functions
For a function to have an inverse that is also a function, it must pass the **Horizontal Line Test**. 
* If a horizontal line touches $f(x)$ twice, then after the reflection across $y=x$, a **vertical line** would touch the new graph twice.
* This is why we must restrict the domain of parabolas (like $y=x^2$) before reflecting them; otherwise, the reflection would be a "sideways" parabola that fails the vertical line test.

---

#### 4. Quick Sketch Guide
1. Draw the line **$y = x$** as a dashed diagonal.
2. Identify 3-4 key points on $f(x)$ (intercepts, vertex, etc.).
3. **Swap the coordinates** for those points.
4. Plot the new points and connect them, maintaining the "mirrored" curvature.
### Inverse Functions: $f(x) = \frac{5-x}{3x}$

An **inverse function** $f^{-1}(x)$ reverses the effect of the original function. Essentially, if $f$ maps $x$ to $y$, then $f^{-1}$ maps $y$ back to $x$.

---

#### 1. Finding the Inverse
To find the inverse of $f(x) = \frac{5-x}{3x}$, follow these algebraic steps:

1. **Set to $y$:** $y = \frac{5-x}{3x}$
2. **Swap $x$ and $y$:** $x = \frac{5-y}{3y}$
3. **Solve for the new $y$:** $x(3y) = 5 - y$  
   $3xy + y = 5$  
   $y(3x + 1) = 5$  
   $y = \frac{5}{3x+1}$

**Result:** $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{5}{3x+1}$$

---

#### 2. How it Works (The Composition Rule)
Inverse functions are defined by the fact that their **composition** results in the identity function $x$. In Obsidian/MathJax notation:

$$(f \circ f^{-1})(x) = x \quad \text{and} \quad (f^{-1} \circ f)(x) = x$$

#### Numerical Example:
* **Original:** If we plug $x = 1$ into $f(x)$:  
    $f(1) = \frac{5 - 1}{3(1)} = \frac{4}{3}$
* **Inverse:** If we plug that result ($\frac{4}{3}$) into $f^{-1}(x)$:  
    $f^{-1}(\frac{4}{3}) = \frac{5}{3(\frac{4}{3}) + 1} = \frac{5}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = \mathbf{1}$

The inverse successfully "undid" the original operation and returned us to our starting value.

## 2025-December-26 - Angles and Their Measures :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h14m35s
- Angles are commonly measured using either or **Degrees** or **Radians** :
- For degrees :  
  a full circle measures : $360\degree$   or  
  half circle measures : $180\degree$ 
  One third circle measures : $120\degree$
- For radians:
   a full circle measures : $2 \pi$ radians(two pi radians)  or 
   half circle measures : $\pi$  radians (pi radians)
   One quarter of a circle measures : $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (pi over 2 radians)
- To convert between degrees and radians :
  $180\degree$ = $\pi$ radians
### Angle Conversion Examples

To convert between degrees and radians, use the conversion factor:
**$\pi \text{ radians} = 180^\circ$**

---

#### 1. Convert $-135^\circ$ to Radians
To convert degrees to radians, multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180^\circ}$:
$$-135^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{-135\pi}{180}$$
Divide both by 45:
$$= -\frac{3\pi}{4} \text{ radians}$$

#### 2. Convert $\frac{5\pi}{4}$ Radians to Degrees
To convert radians to degrees, multiply by $\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$:
$$\frac{5\pi}{4} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{5 \times 180^\circ}{4}$$
$$= 5 \times 45^\circ = 225^\circ$$

#### 3. Convert $7$ Radians to Degrees
When $\pi$ is not present in the radian measure, use the decimal value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$:
$$7 \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{1260^\circ}{\pi}$$
$$\approx 401.07^\circ$$

---
#### Conversion Cheat Sheet
* **Degrees $\to$ Radians:** Multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$
* **Radians $\to$ Degrees:** Multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$
### Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS)

When we need to measure angles more precisely than a single degree, we use **DMS** notation. This is similar to how we break down hours into minutes and seconds.

* **Degrees ($^\circ$):** The primary unit of angular measure.
* **Minutes ($'$):** Each degree is divided into **60 minutes**. ($1^\circ = 60'$)
* **Seconds ($''$):** Each minute is divided into **60 seconds**. ($1' = 60''$)

**The Hierarchy:**
$1 \text{ Degree} = 60 \text{ Minutes} = 3,600 \text{ Seconds}$

---

#### Example 1: Convert $32^\circ 17' 25''$ to decimal degrees
To convert to a decimal, we divide each part by its respective power of 60.

1.  **Keep the whole degrees:** $32$
2.  **Convert minutes:** $\frac{17}{60} \approx 0.283333$
3.  **Convert seconds:** $\frac{25}{3600} \approx 0.006944$
4.  **Sum them up:** $32 + 0.283333 + 0.006944 = 32.290277^\circ$

**Result:** $\approx 32.2903^\circ$

---

#### Example 2: Convert $247.3486^\circ$ to DMS
To convert a decimal to DMS, we multiply the fractional parts by 60.

1.  **Extract the degrees:** $247^\circ$
2.  **Find the minutes:** Multiply the remaining decimal by 60.
    * $0.3486 \times 60 = 20.916$
    * The whole number is **$20'$**.
3.  **Find the seconds:** Multiply the new remaining decimal by 60.
    * $0.916 \times 60 = 54.96$
    * The result is approximately **$55''$**.

**Result:** $247^\circ 20' 55''$

## 2025-December-26 - Arclength and Areas of Sectors :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h22m50s
- **Arc** = If you have a circle, a piece of the circumference is called an Arc
- **Sector** = The wedge formed by the arc, is called a sector
- $C = 2\pi r$ : Circumference is 2 pi times the radius
- $A = \pi r^2$ : Area is pi times radius squared
- **$\theta$ (theta)** is the standard Greek letter used to denote the measure of a **central angle** or the **angular position** of a point relative to a fixed reference line.
### Arc Length and Sector Area

In a circle of radius $r$, the length of an arc and the area of a sector are directly proportional to the central angle $\theta$ that subtends them.



---

#### 1. Arc Length ($s$)
The arc length is the distance along the curved part of the circle.

* **When $\theta$ is in Radians:**
  $$s = r\theta$$
  *(This is the simplest form because radians are defined by the ratio of arc length to radius.)*

* **When $\theta$ is in Degrees:**
  $$s = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r$$
  *(This takes the fraction of the total circumference $2\pi r$.)*

---

#### 2. Area of a Sector ($A$)
A sector is a "pie slice" of the circle.

* **When $\theta$ is in Radians:**
  $$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$$

* **When $\theta$ is in Degrees:**
  $$A = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$$
  *(This takes the fraction of the total area $\pi r^2$.)*

---

#### Summary Table for Obsidian
| Feature               | Formula (Radians)      | Formula (Degrees)                  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Arc Length ($s$)**  | $r\theta$              | $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot 2\pi r$  |
| **Sector Area ($A$)** | $\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$ | $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi r^2$ |

> [!TIP] Conversion Reminder
> If you are given an angle in degrees and want to use the simpler radian formulas, multiply the degrees by $\frac{\pi}{180}$ first!

### Example: Calculating Arclength

**Problem:**
A circular pool has a radius of $8 \text{ meters}$. Find the arclength spanned by a central angle of $2.5 \text{ radians}$.

---

#### 1. Formula
When the central angle $\theta$ is given in **radians**, the formula for arclength ($s$) is:
$$s = r\theta$$

#### 2. Variables
* **Radius ($r$):** $8 \text{ m}$
* **Central Angle ($\theta$):** $2.5 \text{ rad}$

#### 3. Calculation
$$s = 8 \text{ m} \times 2.5 \text{ rad}$$
$$s = 20 \text{ m}$$

**Result:** The arclength is **$20 \text{ meters}$**.

---
> [!TIP] Note on Units
> Since radians are a dimensionless ratio, the final unit of the arclength matches the unit of the radius (meters).
### Example: Calculating Sector Area

**Problem:**
Find the area of a sector of a circle with a radius of $10 \text{ meters}$ that spans an angle of $\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians}$.

---

#### 1. Formula
When the central angle $\theta$ is given in **radians**, the formula for the area of a sector ($A$) is:
$$A = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$$

#### 2. Variables
* **Radius ($r$):** $10 \text{ m}$
* **Central Angle ($\theta$):** $\frac{\pi}{6} \text{ rad}$

#### 3. Calculation
Substitute the values into the formula:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times (10)^2 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$
$$A = 50 \times \frac{\pi}{6}$$

**Simplify the fraction:**
$$A = \frac{25\pi}{3} \text{ m}^2$$

**Decimal Approximation:**
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$:
$$A \approx 26.18 \text{ m}^2$$

**Result:** The area of the sector is **$\frac{25\pi}{3} \text{ m}^2$** (or approximately **$26.18 \text{ m}^2$**).

---
> [!TIP] Units Matter
> Since area is a two-dimensional measure, ensure your final units are squared (meters $\rightarrow$ meters$^2$).
### Area of a Sector Formulas

The area of a sector (a "pie slice" of a circle) depends on the radius ($r$) and the central angle ($\theta$).

---

#### 1. The Formulas
Choose the formula based on the unit of your angle:

| Angle Unit                 | Formula                                 |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Radians**                | $A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta$            |
| **Degrees**                | $A = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$ |
| **Using Arc Length ($s$)** | $A = \frac{1}{2} r s$                   |



---

#### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Identify the Radius ($r$):** The distance from the center to the edge.
2. **Identify the Angle ($\theta$):** Determine if it is in degrees or radians.
3. **Square the Radius:** Calculate $r^2$.
4. **Apply the Formula:** * *If Radians:* Multiply $0.5 \times r^2 \times \theta$.
	* *If Degrees:* Multiply $( \theta / 360 ) \times \pi \times r^2$.

---

#### 3. Worked Example
**Problem:** Find the area of a sector with a radius of $6\text{ cm}$ and a central angle of $60^\circ$.

**Solution (Degree Method):**
$$A = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi \times (6)^2$$
$$A = \frac{1}{6} \times 36\pi$$
$$A = 6\pi \approx 18.85\text{ cm}^2$$
## 2025-December-27 - Linear and Radial Speed :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI4an8aSsgw&t=1h28m40s
- **Angular Speed** = $\frac{angle}{time}$ = Spinning Wheel Analogy : Angle it goes through in a unit of time
- **Linear Speed** = $\frac{distance}{time}$ = The speed of a point on the rim of the wheel - The distance a point on rim of wheel travels in a unit of time
### Physics Problem: Circular Motion of a Ferris Wheel

#### Given Data:
* **Radius ($r$):** $20\text{ m}$
* **Time for 1 revolution ($T$):** $2\text{ minutes} = 120\text{ seconds}$

---

#### 1. Angular Speed ($\omega$)
Angular speed is the rate at which the central angle changes. Since one full revolution is $2\pi$ radians:

$$\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

**Calculation:**
$$\omega = \frac{2\pi \text{ rad}}{120 \text{ s}} = \frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s} \approx 0.0524 \text{ rad/s}$$


#### 2. Linear Speed ($v$)
The linear speed (tangential speed) of a point on the rim is related to the angular speed by the formula:

$$v = r\omega$$

**Calculation:**
$$v = 20\text{ m} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s}\right)$$
$$v = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ m/s} \approx 1.047 \text{ m/s}$$

---

#### Summary Table
| Metric            | Formula                   | Result (Exact)                 | Result (Approx)        |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Angular Speed** | $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ | $\frac{\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s}$ | $0.0524 \text{ rad/s}$ |

## 2025-December-27 - Right Angle Trigonometry :

![[Pasted image 20251227181120.png]]
### 2025-December-27 - Right Angle Trigonometry

In a right-angled triangle, we define trigonometric ratios based on the angle $\theta$ and the relationship between the triangle's three sides: the **Opposite** (side across from $\theta$), the **Adjacent** (side next to $\theta$), and the **Hypotenuse** (the longest side).

---

### Primary Trigonometric Ratios (SOH CAH TOA)
* **Sin** ($\sin \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Cos** ($\cos \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
* **Tan** ($\tan \theta$) = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$

---

### Physics/Math Example: Kite Height

**Given:**
* **Angle of Elevation ($\theta$):** $75^\circ$
* **Hypotenuse ($h$ - length of string):** $100\text{ m}$
* **Target:** Find the **Opposite** side (height of the kite).

---

#### Step 1: Identify the correct ratio
We have the **Hypotenuse** and the **Angle**, and we need the **Opposite** side. Based on **SOH** CAH TOA:

$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$

---

#### Step 2: Set up the equation
$$\sin(75^\circ) = \frac{\text{height}}{100\text{ m}}$$

**Solve for height:**
$$\text{height} = 100 \times \sin(75^\circ)$$

---

#### Step 3: Final Calculation
Using $\sin(75^\circ) \approx 0.9659$:

$$\text{height} \approx 100 \times 0.9659$$
$$\text{height} \approx 96.59\text{ meters}$$

---
**Summary Result:** The kite is flying at a height of approximately **96.59 m**.

### Deriving Trig Ratios for 45° (Hypotenuse = 1)

To find the exact values of $\sin(45^\circ)$ and $\cos(45^\circ)$ without a calculator, we use the properties of an **Isosceles Right Triangle** (also known as a 45-45-90 triangle).

#### 1. Geometry of the Triangle
In a triangle where two angles are $45^\circ$, the sides opposite those angles must be equal. 
* Let the two legs (Opposite and Adjacent) be $x$.
* The Hypotenuse is given as $1$.

#### 2. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem
We use $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ to solve for $x$:

$$x^2 + x^2 = 1^2$$
$$2x^2 = 1$$
$$x^2 = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

#### 3. Rationalizing the Denominator
To simplify $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we multiply the top and bottom by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$x = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

#### 4. Calculating the Ratios
Now we apply the definitions of Sine and Cosine:

* **Sin(45°)** = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* **Cos(45°)** = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

---
**Summary:**
* $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
### Special Right Triangle: 45-45-90 (Hypotenuse = 5)

To find the trigonometric ratios for $45^\circ$ without a calculator, we use an **Isosceles Right Triangle**. Because two angles are $45^\circ$, the sides opposite them (the legs) must be equal in length.

#### 1. Solving for the Legs
Let both the **Opposite** and **Adjacent** sides be represented by $x$. The hypotenuse is given as $5$.



Using the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$):
$$x^2 + x^2 = 5^2$$
$$2x^2 = 25$$
$$x^2 = \frac{25}{2}$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{25}{2}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}$$

To rationalize the denominator:
$$x = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

#### 2. Calculating the Ratios
Now, we apply the definitions of Sine, Cosine, and Tangent (SOH CAH TOA):

* **$\sin(45^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\cos(45^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

* **$\tan(45^\circ)$** (Opposite / Adjacent):
    $$\frac{5\sqrt{2}/2}{5\sqrt{2}/2} = 1$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
* $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$
### Special Right Triangle: 30-60-90 (Hypotenuse = 1)

To find the exact values for $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ without a calculator, we use the properties of a **30-60-90 triangle**. This triangle is essentially half of an equilateral triangle.

#### 1. Geometry of the Triangle
* Start with an equilateral triangle where all sides are $1$. 
* Bisect it down the middle to create two right triangles.
* In these right triangles:
    * The **Hypotenuse** stays $1$.
    * The **Short Leg** (opposite the $30^\circ$ angle) becomes exactly half of the original side: $\frac{1}{2}$.


#### 2. Solving for the Long Leg
We use the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) where $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $c = 1$:

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + b^2 = 1^2$$
$$\frac{1}{4} + b^2 = 1$$
$$b^2 = \frac{3}{4}$$
$$b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

#### 3. Calculating the Ratios
Using the triangle where the **Opposite** side to $30^\circ$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, the **Adjacent** side is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and the **Hypotenuse** is $1$:

* **$\sin(30^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}$$

* **$\cos(30^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$ (or $\frac{1}{2}$)
* $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
### Special Right Triangle: Finding 60° Ratios

To find the exact values for $60^\circ$ without a calculator, we use the same **30-60-90 triangle** derived from an equilateral triangle with sides of length $1$.

#### Geometry of the 60° Angle
In this triangle, when we focus on the $60^\circ$ angle:
* The **Opposite** side is the altitude: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
* The **Adjacent** side is the base: $\frac{1}{2}$.
* The **Hypotenuse** remains: $1$.



#### Calculating the Ratios
Using the definitions of Sine and Cosine (SOH CAH TOA):

* **$\sin(60^\circ)$** (Opposite / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

* **$\cos(60^\circ)$** (Adjacent / Hypotenuse):
    $$\frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}$$

---
**Summary Results:**
* $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
* $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$

### Properties of Trigonometric Functions & Periodicity

Trigonometric functions are **periodic**, meaning their values repeat at regular intervals. This behavior is best understood by observing a point $(x, y)$ moving around the **Unit Circle** (a circle with radius $r = 1$).

#### 1. The Unit Circle Definitions
On the unit circle, any angle $\theta$ corresponds to a point $(x, y)$. Since $r=1$, the standard trig ratios simplify to:
* **$\cos(\theta) = x$**
* **$\sin(\theta) = y$**
* **$\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$** (where $x \neq 0$)

#### 2. Periodic Property
As you rotate around the circle, once you complete a full revolution ($360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians), you land back on the exact same $(x, y)$ coordinates. This creates the periodic nature of the functions.

##### Sine and Cosine Period ($2\pi$)
The values of Sine and Cosine repeat every $2\pi$ radians.
* $\sin(\theta + 2\pi n) = \sin(\theta)$
* $\cos(\theta + 2\pi n) = \cos(\theta)$
*(where $n$ is any integer)*

##### Tangent and Cotangent Period ($\pi$)
The Tangent function repeats more frequently, every half-rotation, because the ratio of $y/x$ returns to the same value in opposite quadrants (e.g., both $x$ and $y$ are negative in Quadrant III, making the ratio positive again).
* $\tan(\theta + \pi n) = \tan(\theta)$
#### 3. Domain and Range
| Function           | Domain                                  | Range               |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **$\sin(\theta)$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$                     | $[-1, 1]$           |
| **$\cos(\theta)$** | $(-\infty, \infty)$                     | $[-1, 1]$           |
| **$\tan(\theta)$** | All $\theta \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n$ | $(-\infty, \infty)$ |

#### 4. Even and Odd Properties
* **Cosine is Even:** Symmetric about the y-axis. $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
* **Sine is Odd:** Symmetric about the origin. $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
* **Tangent is Odd:** Symmetric about the origin. $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
### Even and Odd Properties of Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions exhibit symmetry properties based on whether they are **even** or **odd**. These properties allow us to simplify expressions involving negative angles by relating them back to their positive counterparts.

#### 1. Even Functions: Cosine and Secant
A function is **even** if its graph is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. Algebraically, this means $f(-\theta) = f(\theta)$.

When you rotate an angle $-\theta$ (clockwise), the $x$-coordinate (Cosine) remains exactly the same as it would for the positive angle $\theta$ (counter-clockwise).

* **Cosine Property:** $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
* **Secant Property:** $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$

#### 2. Odd Functions: Sine, Tangent, Cosecant, and Cotangent
A function is **odd** if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. Algebraically, this means $f(-\theta) = -f(\theta)$.

When you rotate an angle $-\theta$, the $y$-coordinate (Sine) becomes the negative of the $y$-coordinate for the positive angle $\theta$. 

**Why Tangent is Odd:**
Since $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$, substituting a negative angle gives:
$$\tan(-\theta) = \frac{\sin(-\theta)}{\cos(-\theta)} = \frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = -\tan(\theta)$$
Because the numerator (Sine) changes sign but the denominator (Cosine) does not, the entire Tangent ratio becomes negative.

* **Sine Property:** $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
* **Cosecant Property:** $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$
* **Tangent Property:** $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
* **Cotangent Property:** $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$

#### 3. Summary Table
| Function Type | Basic Identity            | Symmetry                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| **Even**      | $f(-\theta) = f(\theta)$  | Symmetric about **y-axis** |
| **Odd**       | $f(-\theta) = -f(\theta)$ | Symmetric about **origin** |

**Example Calculation:**
* If $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$, then $\cos(-60^\circ) = 0.5$.
* If $\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5$, then $\sin(-30^\circ) = -0.5$.
* If $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$, then $\tan(-45^\circ) = -1$.
### Pythagorean Identity & Trig Properties

The Pythagorean Identity is the most fundamental relationship in trigonometry. It bridges the gap between the geometry of a right triangle and the algebraic properties of the Unit Circle.

#### 1. Derivation from the Unit Circle
In a coordinate plane, any point on a circle with radius $r$ centered at the origin follows the equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. On the **Unit Circle**, where the radius $r = 1$:

* The $x$-coordinate is defined as $\cos(\theta)$.
* The $y$-coordinate is defined as $\sin(\theta)$.

Substituting these into the circle equation gives the primary identity:
$$\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$$

#### 2. Visualizing the Identity
If you draw a right triangle inside the unit circle:
* The **Horizontal leg** (adjacent) has length $\cos(\theta)$.
* The **Vertical leg** (opposite) has length $\sin(\theta)$.
* The **Hypotenuse** is the radius, which is $1$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$):
$$(\cos \theta)^2 + (\sin \theta)^2 = 1^2$$

#### 3. Related Pythagorean Identities
By dividing the primary identity ($\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$) by either $\cos^2 \theta$ or $\sin^2 \theta$, we derive two other essential forms:

##### The Tangent-Secant Identity
Divide everything by $\cos^2(\theta)$:
$$\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} \implies \tan^2(\theta) + 1 = \sec^2(\theta)$$

##### The Cotangent-Cosecant Identity
Divide everything by $\sin^2(\theta)$:
$$\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \implies 1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)$$

#### 4. Practical Uses
* **Finding Unknown Ratios:** If you know $\sin(\theta)$ and which quadrant the angle is in, you can solve for $\cos(\theta)$ without needing the angle itself.
* **Simplifying Expressions:** In Calculus and Pre-Calculus proofs, seeing $1 - \sin^2(\theta)$ allows you to instantly replace it with $\cos^2(\theta)$.

---
**Summary of Identity Forms:**
1. $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$
2. $\tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta$
3. $1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta$
### Evaluating Trig Functions Using Periodicity

To evaluate trigonometric functions with large or negative angles, we use the **periodic property**. This involves adding or subtracting full rotations ($360^\circ$ or $2\pi$ radians) until the angle is within the standard $0$ to $2\pi$ range.

#### 1. Evaluating $\cos(5\pi)$
The cosine function has a period of $2\pi$. This means we can subtract $2\pi$ repeatedly without changing the result.



**Step-by-step:**
* $5\pi - 2\pi = 3\pi$
* $3\pi - 2\pi = 1\pi$

Now we evaluate at $\pi$ ($180^\circ$):
* On the unit circle, the coordinates at $\pi$ are $(-1, 0)$.
* Since $\cos(\theta) = x$:
$$\cos(5\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1$$

#### 2. Evaluating $\sin(-420^\circ)$
For negative angles, we rotate clockwise. To find the **coterminal angle** (the positive version of the same spot), we add $360^\circ$ until the angle is positive.

**Step-by-step:**
* $-420^\circ + 360^\circ = -60^\circ$
* $-60^\circ + 360^\circ = 300^\circ$

Now we evaluate at $300^\circ$ (which is in Quadrant IV):
* The reference angle is $60^\circ$ ($360^\circ - 300^\circ = 60^\circ$).
* In Quadrant IV, **Sine is negative**.
* From our special angles: $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Therefore:
$$\sin(-420^\circ) = -\sin(60^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

---
**Summary of Results:**
* $\cos(5\pi) = -1$
* $\sin(-420^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
