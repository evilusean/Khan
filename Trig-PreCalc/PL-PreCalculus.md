- **Function** = A relationship that maps one input to one output - An input never gives more than 1 output (one x to ANY y)
- **One to One Function** : A relationship that maps one input to one *unique* output (can't be shared) (one x to ONE y)
- **Function Notation** : **f(x)** = **y** : function of *x* equals *y*
- **Independant Variable** : *x* (your input is always independant) you can choose
- **Dependant Variable** : *y* (your out put is always dependant on the input) you can not chosen
- Functions create an *ordered pair* : (x, y) or (x, f(x))
- **Domain** : set of values you input into a function (*x*'s)
- **Range** : Set of values you get as output (*y*'s)
- To find out if an equation is a function, solve for '*y*' (the dependant variable)
- $\sqrt{y^2} =\pm \sqrt{x}$ : when you square something to get rid of the exponent, be careful, because the squared can be plus or minus (2 different outputs) and not a function - when solving for *y* **ANY** time you have to take a square root to solve it, it will have a plus or minus and *NOT* be a function
## 2026-March-07 - How to Evaluate Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 3) :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1sGAHulT8w&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=5
- A **composition function**, denoted as $(f \circ g)(x)$ or $f(g(x))$, is an operation where the output of one function becomes the input of another, creating a "chain" where the final result depends on the sequential evaluation of both rules.
- $y = -7x + 5$ : $f(x) = -7x+5$ : they are the same
- Why do you use *Function Notation*? Because if every function was named '*y*' it would be very hard to distinguish between them, so it's better to use $f(x)$
- $f(2)$ : means plug in *2* everywhere you see *x*
- Only numbers in the *domain* are real (no imaginary numbers like $\sqrt{-2}$ or '0') positive numbers (>0) - *Square Roots* and *Denominators* can give you problems, so make sure to check your domain inputs for those
- **Difference Quotient** : $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ :  
### h(x) = -2x² + x - 1

To evaluate $h(x) = -2x^2 + x - 1$, substitute the given value or expression into every instance of $x$ in the original function.

---

#### 1. Evaluate h(-1)
Substitute $-1$ for $x$:
$$h(-1) = -2(-1)^2 + (-1) - 1$$
$$h(-1) = -2(1) - 1 - 1$$
$$h(-1) = -2 - 1 - 1$$
**$h(-1) = -4$**

---

#### 2. Evaluate h(-x)
Substitute $-x$ for $x$:
$$h(-x) = -2(-x)^2 + (-x) - 1$$
Since $(-x)^2 = x^2$ and $+(-x) = -x$:
**$h(-x) = -2x^2 - x - 1$**

---

#### 3. Evaluate h(x + 1)
Substitute the expression $(x + 1)$ for $x$:
$$h(x + 1) = -2(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1) - 1$$

**Step A: Expand the binomial**
$$(x + 1)^2 = (x + 1)(x + 1) = x^2 + 2x + 1$$

**Step B: Distribute the -2**
$$h(x + 1) = -2(x^2 + 2x + 1) + x + 1 - 1$$
$$h(x + 1) = -2x^2 - 4x - 2 + x + 0$$

**Step C: Combine like terms**
**$h(x + 1) = -2x^2 - 3x - 2$**

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> When evaluating $h(x+1)$, the most common error is forgetting to expand the binomial $(x+1)^2$ fully before multiplying by $-2$. Always follow the Order of Operations (**PEMDAS**): handle the exponent (squaring the binomial) before performing the multiplication.
### $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 - 3x}$

To evaluate these, substitute the given value or expression into every $x$ under the radical.

---

#### 1. Evaluate $f(5)$
$$f(5) = \sqrt{(5)^2 - 3(5)}$$
$$f(5) = \sqrt{25 - 15}$$
**$f(5) = \sqrt{10}$**

---

#### 2. Evaluate $f(0)$
$$f(0) = \sqrt{(0)^2 - 3(0)}$$
$$f(0) = \sqrt{0 - 0}$$
**$f(0) = 0$**

---

#### 3. Evaluate $f(2x)$
$$f(2x) = \sqrt{(2x)^2 - 3(2x)}$$
Square both the $2$ and the $x$ inside the first term:
**$f(2x) = \sqrt{4x^2 - 6x}$**

---

#### 4. Evaluate $f(x + h)$
$$f(x + h) = \sqrt{(x + h)^2 - 3(x + h)}$$
Expand the squared binomial and distribute the $-3$:
**$f(x + h) = \sqrt{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - 3x - 3h}$**

---

#### 5. Evaluate $f(1)$
$$f(1) = \sqrt{(1)^2 - 3(1)}$$
$$f(1) = \sqrt{1 - 3}$$
**$f(1) = \sqrt{-2}$**
*(Note: Undefined in the real number system; results in $i\sqrt{2}$.)*

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> When working with square root functions, the **domain** is restricted. If the value inside the radical is negative, the function has no real-number output. As seen with $f(1)$, $x=1$ is not in the domain.
### $g(x) = \frac{2x+1}{x-5}$

To evaluate this rational function, substitute the given value or expression into every instance of $x$ in both the numerator and the denominator.

---

#### 1. Evaluate $g(0)$
Substitute $0$ for $x$:
$$g(0) = \frac{2(0) + 1}{0 - 5}$$
$$g(0) = \frac{1}{-5}$$
**$g(0) = -\frac{1}{5}$**

---

#### 2. Evaluate $g(x^2)$
Substitute $x^2$ for $x$:
**$g(x^2) = \frac{2x^2 + 1}{x^2 - 5}$**

---

#### 3. Evaluate $g(5)$
Substitute $5$ for $x$:
$$g(5) = \frac{2(5) + 1}{5 - 5}$$
$$g(5) = \frac{11}{0}$$
**$g(5) = \text{Undefined}$**
*(Note: Division by zero is impossible, meaning $x = 5$ is an exclusion from the domain.)*


---

#### 4. Evaluate $-g(x)$
This is the negative of the entire function. You can distribute the negative to either the numerator OR the denominator, but not both:
$$-g(x) = -\left(\frac{2x + 1}{x - 5}\right)$$
**$-g(x) = \frac{-2x - 1}{x - 5}$** *(Commonly represented this way)*

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> When evaluating rational functions like $g(5)$, a zero in the denominator indicates a **vertical asymptote** or a "hole" in the graph. In your Obsidian vault, you can link this to **Domain Restrictions**, as $x$ can be any real number except $5$. When calculating $-g(x)$, be careful not to multiply both top and bottom by $-1$, as that would actually result in the original function (a double negative).
### Identifying Even, Odd, and Neither Functions

To determine the symmetry of a function, you use the **"$-x$ Plugin"** test. This involves substituting every $x$ in the function with $(-x)$ and comparing the result to the original function.

---
#### 1. Even Functions (Symmetric about the y-axis)
A function is **Even** if plugging in $-x$ results in the exact same original function.
* **Condition:** $f(-x) = f(x)$
* **Visual:** If you fold the graph along the y-axis, the two sides match perfectly.
---
#### 2. Odd Functions (Symmetric about the origin)
A function is **Odd** if plugging in $-x$ results in the original function with every sign flipped (the negative of the original).
* **Condition:** $f(-x) = -f(x)$
* **Visual:** If you rotate the graph $180^\circ$ around the $(0,0)$ point, it looks identical.
---
#### 3. Neither
A function is **Neither** if the result of the $-x$ substitution does not match the original function and is not the exact negative of the original.
* **Condition:** $f(-x) \neq f(x)$ AND $f(-x) \neq -f(x)$
---
#### Step-by-Step Plugin Examples

**Example A: $f(x) = x^2 + 5$**
1. Substitute $-x$: $f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 5$
2. Simplify: $f(-x) = x^2 + 5$
3. **Result:** Matches original. **Even.**

**Example B: $f(x) = x^3 - x$**
1. Substitute $-x$: $f(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x)$
2. Simplify: $f(-x) = -x^3 + x$
3. Factor out $-1$: $f(-x) = -(x^3 - x)$
4. **Result:** Matches negative of original. **Odd.**

**Example C: $f(x) = 2x + 1$**
1. Substitute $-x$: $f(-x) = 2(-x) + 1$
2. Simplify: $f(-x) = -2x + 1$
3. **Result:** Neither original nor exact negative (the $+1$ didn't flip). **Neither.**

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> When using the $-x$ plugin, remember that **even exponents** (2, 4, 6...) will always "absorb" the negative sign, while **odd exponents** (1, 3, 5...) will "keep" the negative sign. Constants (like $+5$) are unaffected by the $-x$ substitution.### Difference Quotient

* The **Difference Quotient**, $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, is a formula used to find the **average rate of change** between two points on a curve, which represents the slope of a **secant line**. As $h$ approaches zero, this formula becomes the foundation for the derivative, allowing you to find the slope at a single specific point.
---
#### Step-by-Step Execution Guide

To solve the difference quotient for any function $f(x)$, follow these three steps to keep the algebra clean:

1.  **Find $f(x+h)$:** Substitute $(x+h)$ into the original function and expand/simplify it completely.
2.  **Subtract $f(x)$:** Subtract the original function from your result in Step 1. This should cause all terms without an $h$ to cancel out.
3.  **Divide by $h$:** Factor out an $h$ from the numerator and cancel it with the $h$ in the denominator.

---

#### Example: $f(x) = x^2 + 3$

**Step 1: Evaluate $f(x+h)$**
$$f(x+h) = (x+h)^2 + 3$$
$$f(x+h) = x^2 + 2xh + h^2 + 3$$

**Step 2: Subtract $f(x)$**
$$(x^2 + 2xh + h^2 + 3) - (x^2 + 3)$$
$$x^2 + 2xh + h^2 + 3 - x^2 - 3$$
Remaining: **$2xh + h^2$**

**Step 3: Divide by $h$**
$$\frac{2xh + h^2}{h} = \frac{h(2x + h)}{h}$$
**Result: $2x + h$**

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> The primary goal of simplifying a difference quotient is to **cancel the $h$ in the denominator**. If you reach the final step and you cannot factor an $h$ out of every term in the numerator, you likely made a distribution or sign error in Step 2.

$$(x^2 + 2xh + h^2 + 3) - (x^2 + 3)$$
$$x^2 + 2xh + h^2 + 3 - x^2 - 3$$
Remaining: **$2xh + h^2$**

**Step 3: Divide by $h$**
$$\frac{2xh + h^2}{h} = \frac{h(2x + h)}{h}$$

## 2026-March-09 - Finding the Domain of Functions (Precalculus - College Algebra 4)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvUCDcp6Z3k&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP&index=6
- **Domain** = Is the set of inputs of a function that can give a *DEFINED* *REAL* number output (not imaginary, and defined aka not zero, and some functions can't handle negative numbers)
- Two Problem Areas : 
  - $\sqrt{1}$  you *CAN NOT have a negative square root radicand* (imaginary number) - A square root will tell you what numbers it wants to have, find numbers that when you plug in will be $\ge 0$ - You can plug in negative numbers to a square root as long as the resulting number is POSITIVE or at least ZERO
  - $\frac{1}{0}$ *Denominators can not equal to zero* - it will tell you what numbers it can't have
- 
### Finding the Domain of $f(x) = \sqrt{5-4x}$

To find the domain of a square root function, the expression inside the radical (the radicand) must be greater than or equal to zero, as you cannot take the square root of a negative number in the real number system.

---

#### Step 1: Set up the Inequality
Set the radicand to be $\ge 0$:
$$5 - 4x \ge 0$$

#### Step 2: Solve for x
Subtract 5 from both sides:
$$-4x \ge -5$$

#### Step 3: Divide by -4
**Crucial Rule:** When dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number, you must **flip the inequality sign**.
$$x \le \frac{-5}{-4}$$
$$x \le 1.25$$

---

#### Final Domain Notation
* **Inequality Notation:** $x \le \frac{5}{4}$
* **Interval Notation:** $(-\infty, \frac{5}{4}]$
* **Set Builder Notation:** $\{x | x \in \mathbb{R}, x \le \frac{5}{4}\}$

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> The "Plugin" test is a quick way to verify your domain. If you pick a number larger than $1.25$ (like $x=2$), the result is $\sqrt{5-8}$, which is $\sqrt{-3}$ (undefined). If you pick a number smaller than $1.25$ (like $x=0$), the result is $\sqrt{5}$ (defined). This confirms the domain must include all values **less than or equal to** $1.25$.
### Finding the Domain of $g(t) = \frac{5t}{t^3 - 16t}$

To find the domain of a rational function (a fraction), you must identify all values that would cause the **denominator to equal zero**, as division by zero is undefined.

---

#### Step 1: Set the Denominator to Zero
We need to solve for $t$ when the bottom part of the fraction is zero:
$$t^3 - 16t = 0$$

#### Step 2: Factor the Expression
First, factor out the greatest common factor, which is $t$:
$$t(t^2 - 16) = 0$$

Next, recognize that $(t^2 - 16)$ is a **difference of squares** ($a^2 - b^2$):
$$t(t - 4)(t + 4) = 0$$

#### Step 3: Solve for Excluded Values
Set each factor to zero:
* $t = 0$
* $t - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow t = 4$
* $t + 4 = 0 \Rightarrow t = -4$

---

#### Final Domain Notation
The domain includes all real numbers **except** $-4, 0,$ and $4$.

* **Inequality Notation:** $t \neq -4, t \neq 0, t \neq 4$
* **Interval Notation:** $(-\infty, -4) \cup (-4, 0) \cup (0, 4) \cup (4, \infty)$
* **Set Builder Notation:** $\{t \mid t \in \mathbb{R}, t \neq \pm 4, t \neq 0\}$

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> In this specific function, you might notice a $t$ in both the numerator and denominator. While they could algebraically "cancel out," the **original** function still has a hole at $t=0$. When finding the domain, always analyze the denominator in its **original, unsimplified form** to ensure you don't miss any points where the function is undefined.
### Finding the Domain of f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 4

To find the domain of a function, you look for restricted operations, such as division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.

---

#### Step 1: Analyze the Function Type
The function $f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 4$ is a **polynomial function** (specifically a quadratic). 

#### Step 2: Check for Restrictions
* **Denominators:** There are no variables in a denominator (no division by zero).
* **Radicals:** There are no square roots or even-indexed roots (no negative radicands).
* **Logarithms:** There are no logarithmic expressions.

Since there are no operations that would lead to an undefined result, you can plug any real number into $x$ and get a valid output.

---

#### Final Domain Notation
The domain is all real numbers.

* **Inequality Notation:** $-\infty < x < \infty$
* **Interval Notation:** $(-\infty, \infty)$
* **Set Builder Notation:** $\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}\}$

---

> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> All polynomial functions—whether they are linear, quadratic, cubic, or higher—have a domain of **all real numbers**. In Obsidian, you can categorize this as a "unrestricted domain." The graph of this function is a parabola that continues infinitely to the left and right, meaning every $x$-value is accounted for.
### Finding the Domain of $h(x) = \sqrt{\frac{3x - 15}{x - 4}}$

Finding the domain of a radical containing a fraction is more complex. For the function to be defined, the entire expression inside the square root (the radicand) must be **greater than or equal to zero**, and the denominator **cannot be zero**.

---

#### Step 1: Identify Critical Points
The sign of the fraction $\frac{3x - 15}{x - 4}$ changes at the values where the numerator or denominator equals zero:
* **Numerator:** $3x - 15 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 5$ (The function can be zero)
* **Denominator:** $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ (The function is undefined here)

#### Step 2: Test the Intervals
These points divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, 4)$, $(4, 5)$, and $(5, \infty)$. We test a value from each to see if the fraction is positive:

1.  **Interval $(-\infty, 4)$:** Test $x = 0$
    $$\frac{3(0) - 15}{0 - 4} = \frac{-15}{-4} = 3.75$$ (Positive/Defined ✅)
2.  **Interval $(4, 5)$:** Test $x = 4.5$
    $$\frac{3(4.5) - 15}{4.5 - 4} = \frac{13.5 - 15}{0.5} = \frac{-1.5}{0.5} = -3$$ (Negative/Undefined ❌)
3.  **Interval $(5, \infty)$:** Test $x = 6$
    $$\frac{3(6) - 15}{6 - 4} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$ (Positive/Defined ✅)

#### Step 3: Check the Boundaries
* **At $x = 4$:** The denominator is zero, so $4$ is **excluded** (parenthesis).
* **At $x = 5$:** The numerator is zero, which is allowed inside a square root ($\sqrt{0} = 0$), so $5$ is **included** (bracket).

---

#### Final Domain Notation
* **Inequality Notation:** $x < 4$ or $x \ge 5$
* **Interval Notation:** $(-\infty, 4) \cup [5, \infty)$
* **Set Builder Notation:** $\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, x < 4 \text{ or } x \ge 5\}$
---
> [!abstract] Algebra Takeaway
> When solving a "root of a fraction," the domain is not just where the individual parts are positive, but where the **ratio** is positive. This is why the interval $(-\infty, 4)$ works: even though both the numerator and denominator are negative, their quotient is positive, making the square root possible. Always use a sign chart or test points to avoid missing these "double negative" intervals.
