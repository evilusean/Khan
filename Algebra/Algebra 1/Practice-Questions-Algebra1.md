Use synthetic division to find the quotient $Q(x)$ and the remainder $R$ when the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^4 + 5x^2 - 7$ is divided by the binomial $D(x) = x + 2$. Write your final answer in the mixed form $Q(x) + \frac{R}{D(x)}$.

Perform synthetic division to divide the polynomial $P(x) = 6x^3 - 7x^2 + 5x - 8$ by the binomial $D(x) = 2x - 1$. State the correct final quotient $Q(x)$ and the remainder $R$.

Given the polynomial $P(x) = 3x^5 - x^4 + 10x^3 - 2x + 5$, use synthetic division with the divisor $D(x) = x - 1$ to accomplish two things:
1.  Determine the remainder $R$.
2.  State the quotient $Q(x)$.
