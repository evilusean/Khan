## 📝 Algebra 1 Essential Formulas: Detailed Explanations & Breakdowns

---

#### I. Linear Equations and Graphs

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
> **Description:** This formula calculates the **slope ($m$)** (or rate of change) of a line. The slope quantifies the **steepness and direction** of the line.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: Represents the slope, defined as the ratio of **Vertical Change (Rise)** to **Horizontal Change (Run)**.
> * $(y_2 - y_1)$: The change in the $y$-coordinates (Rise).
> * $(x_2 - x_1)$: The change in the $x$-coordinates (Run).
> **Usage:** Use this when given **two points** on a line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The order of subtraction must be consistent in both the numerator and the denominator.

**Slope-Intercept Form:**
$$y = mx + b$$
> **Description:** This is the most intuitive form for graphing a line. It defines $y$ as a function of $x$ based on the line's key properties.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: The **slope** (rate of change). A positive $m$ means the line rises from left to right; a negative $m$ means it falls.
> * $b$: The **$y$-intercept**. This is the specific point **$(0, b)$** where the line crosses the vertical $y$-axis.
> **Usage:** To graph the line, start at $b$ (the initial value), and then use $m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$ to find subsequent points. Also used to easily identify the properties of any linear function.

**Standard Form:**
$$Ax + By = C$$
> **Description:** A general form where the $x$ and $y$ variables are on the same side. $A$, $B$, and $C$ are typically required to be integers (whole numbers).
> **Breakdown:**
> * $A, B, C$: Integer coefficients and constant. This form is often used to model real-world problems involving limited resources (e.g., $Ax + By$ is the total cost).
> **Usage:** Most useful for solving **systems of linear equations** using the **Elimination Method** and for quickly finding the $x$ and $y$ intercepts by setting the opposite variable to zero.

**Point-Slope Form:**
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
> **Description:** This form allows you to write the equation of a line if you know the slope and only one point. It is derived directly from the Slope Formula.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: The slope.
> * $(x_1, y_1)$: A single, specific point on the line.
> * $(x, y)$: Represents any other point on the line.
> **Usage:** This is the best starting point when given a slope and a point. It can be algebraically rearranged (by distributing $m$ and adding $y_1$) to the Slope-Intercept Form.

**Distance Formula:**
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
> **Description:** Calculates the straight-line distance ($d$) between two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. It is a direct application of the **Pythagorean Theorem** ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) on the coordinate plane.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $(x_2 - x_1)^2$: Represents the square of the horizontal change ($\Delta x^2$).
> * $(y_2 - y_1)^2$: Represents the square of the vertical change ($\Delta y^2$).
> * The final square root gives you the hypotenuse length ($d$).
> **Usage:** Substitute the coordinates, perform the subtraction and squaring *first*, then add the results, and finally take the square root.

**Midpoint Formula:**
$$\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2},\ \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$
> **Description:** Finds the coordinates of the **exact center point** (midpoint) of the line segment connecting two endpoints.
> **Breakdown:**
> * The formula is essentially calculating the **average** (mean) of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates.
> **Usage:** Used to bisect a line segment or find the center of a figure (like the center of a circle from two points on its diameter).

**Parallel Lines:**
$$m_1 = m_2$$
> **Description:** Lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect.
> **Usage:** To be parallel, the lines **must have the exact same slope**.

**Perpendicular Lines:**
$$m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$$
> **Description:** Lines that intersect at a **$90^\circ$ (right) angle**.
> **Usage:** Their slopes must be **negative reciprocals**. (Take the original slope, flip the fraction, and change the sign). If $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, they are perpendicular.

#### II. Laws of Exponents

**Product Rule:**
$$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$
> **Description:** When multiplying exponential expressions with the **same base ($a$)**, you **add** the exponents.
> **Breakdown:** The rule works because you are simply counting the total factors being multiplied. Example: $x^2 \cdot x^3 = (x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x) = x^5$.

**Quotient Rule:**
$$\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}$$
> **Description:** When dividing exponential expressions with the **same base ($a$)**, you **subtract** the exponent of the denominator ($m$) from the exponent of the numerator ($n$).
> **Breakdown:** The subtraction represents the cancellation of common factors in the numerator and denominator.

**Power of a Power Rule:**
$$(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$$
> **Description:** When an exponential term is raised to an external power, you **multiply** the exponents.
> **Breakdown:** Example: $(x^3)^2 = x^3 \cdot x^3$. Applying the Product Rule gives $x^{3+3} = x^6$, which is the same as $x^{3 \cdot 2}$.

**Zero Exponent Rule:**
$$a^0 = 1$$
> **Description:** Any non-zero base ($a$) raised to the power of zero is **always equal to 1**.
> **Breakdown:** This is derived from the Quotient Rule: $\frac{a^n}{a^n} = a^{n-n} = a^0$. Since any number divided by itself is 1, $a^0$ must be 1.

**Negative Exponent Rule:**
$$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$$
> **Description:** A term with a negative exponent is equal to the reciprocal of the term with a positive exponent.
> **Breakdown:** The negative sign dictates a move to the opposite side of the fraction bar (numerator $\leftrightarrow$ denominator) to change the sign of the exponent. Example: $\frac{1}{x^{-2}} = x^2$.

---

#### III. Polynomials and Factoring

**Difference of Squares:**
$$a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$$
> **Description:** This formula works in two ways: it's used to **factor** a binomial (left side to right side), or to quickly multiply two **conjugate binomials** (right side to left side).
> **Breakdown:** The middle terms ($+ab$ and $-ab$) cancel out when multiplying the conjugates, leaving only the difference of the squared terms.

**Perfect Square Trinomial 1:**
$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$$
> **Description:** The result of squaring a binomial with a plus sign.
> **Usage:** Used for factoring: if the first and last terms are perfect squares and the middle term is **twice the product** of their square roots, it's a perfect square trinomial.

**Perfect Square Trinomial 2:**
$$a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a-b)^2$$
> **Description:** The result of squaring a binomial with a minus sign.
> **Usage:** Used for factoring when the first and last terms are perfect squares and the middle term is **negative twice the product** of their square roots.

**FOIL Method:**
First, Outer, Inner, Last (for $$(a+b)(c+d)$$)
> **Description:** A systematic way to remember the four products necessary when **multiplying two binomials** (expressions with two terms).
> **Breakdown:** $\mathbf{F} = a \cdot c$; $\mathbf{O} = a \cdot d$; $\mathbf{I} = b \cdot c$; $\mathbf{L} = b \cdot d$. After multiplying, always combine the resulting $\mathbf{O}$ and $\mathbf{I}$ terms if they are like terms.

---

#### IV. Quadratic Equations

**Standard Form:**
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
> **Description:** The required form for a quadratic equation (a polynomial of degree 2, whose graph is a parabola). All terms are collected on one side, set equal to zero.
> **Breakdown:** $a$ is the leading coefficient (determines parabola's direction and width), $b$ is the linear coefficient, and $c$ is the constant term (the $y$-intercept).

**Quadratic Formula:**
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
> **Description:** A universal tool for finding the **roots** (solutions, zeros, or $x$-intercepts) of **any** quadratic equation in standard form.
> **Breakdown:**
> * The **$\pm$** sign is key: it indicates there are usually two solutions (or one repeated solution).
> * $(-b / 2a)$ is the axis of symmetry (and the $x$-coordinate of the vertex).
> * The entire $\pm \sqrt{\dots}$ part determines the distance from the axis of symmetry to the roots.

**Discriminant:**
$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
> **Description:** The expression **inside the square root** of the Quadratic Formula. It determines the nature and number of the roots without fully solving the equation.
> **Breakdown:**
> * If $\Delta > 0$ (positive): **Two distinct real solutions** (The parabola crosses the $x$-axis twice).
> * If $\Delta = 0$: **One real solution** (The parabola touches the $x$-axis at one point, the vertex).
> * If $\Delta < 0$ (negative): **No real solutions** (The parabola does not cross the $x$-axis).

**Vertex (x-coordinate):**
$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$
> **Description:** This formula finds the **$x$-coordinate** of the **vertex** of the parabola, which is the point of maximum or minimum value. This line is called the **axis of symmetry**.
> **Usage:** Substitute $a$ and $b$ from the standard form. Then, plug this resulting $x$-value back into the original quadratic equation to find the corresponding $y$-coordinate of the vertex.

---

#### V. Sequences

**Arithmetic Sequence (Explicit):**
$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$
> **Description:** This **Explicit Formula** allows you to calculate the value of **any term** ($a_n$) in a sequence where the terms increase or decrease by a **constant difference**.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $a_n$: The $n$-th term you want to find.
> * $a_1$: The value of the first term.
> * $n$: The term number (position in the sequence, e.g., 5th term is $n=5$).
> * $d$: The **common difference** (the amount added or subtracted each time).
> * $(n-1)d$: Represents the total distance traveled from the first term to the $n$-th term.

**Geometric Sequence (Explicit):**
$$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$
> **Description:** This **Explicit Formula** calculates the value of **any term** ($a_n$) in a sequence where the terms change by a **constant ratio** (multiplication).
> **Breakdown:**
> * $r$: The **common ratio** (the amount multiplied each time).
> * $r^{n-1}$: Represents the total times the ratio has been multiplied, starting after the first term.

---

#### VI. Inverse Functions

**Definition:**
If $f(x)$ is a function, its inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.
> **Description:** An inverse function, denoted $f^{-1}(x)$, is one that **undoes** the work of the original function $f(x)$.
> **Breakdown:** The process of applying the function and then its inverse (or vice-versa) results in the original input, $x$. Graphically, the inverse is the reflection of the original function across the line $y=x$.

**Finding the Inverse:**

1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$.
2. Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$.
3. Swap $x$ and $y$.
4. Write as $f^{-1}(x)$.

**Example:**
If $f(x) = 2x + 3$, then $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}$
> **Explanation:** This is the universal algebraic procedure for finding an inverse. **Step 3 (swapping $x$ and $y$)** is the fundamental mathematical action that defines the inverse relationship.

---
#### VII. Rational Functions & Variations

**Rational Function :** A function of the form:
$$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials and $Q(x) \neq 0$.
> **Description:** A function that is the ratio of two polynomials.
> **Breakdown:** The crucial mathematical restriction is that the **denominator $Q(x)$ can never equal zero** because division by zero is undefined. Setting $Q(x) = 0$ identifies values excluded from the domain, which are often the locations of **vertical asymptotes**.

**Direct Variation:**
$$y = kx \quad \text{or} \quad y \propto x$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies directly with $x$. This means $y$ is directly proportional to $x$.
> **Breakdown:** The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always a **constant ($k$)**, the **constant of variation**. As one variable increases, the other increases at the same rate. The graph is a straight line through the origin $(0,0)$.

**Inverse Variation:**
$$yx = k$$
$$y = \frac{k}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad y \propto \frac{1}{x}$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies inversely with $x$.
> **Breakdown:** The **product** $y \cdot x$ is always a **constant ($k$)**. As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases proportionally (and vice-versa). The graph is a hyperbola.

**Joint Variation:**
$$y = kxz$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies directly with **two or more** variables ($x$ and $z$).
> **Usage:** Use a given set of values for $y, x,$ and $z$ to solve for the constant $k$, and then write the complete variation equation.

**Combined Variation:**
$$y = \frac{kx}{z}$$
> **Description:** A relationship combining direct and inverse variation. $y$ varies **directly** with $x$ and **inversely** with $z$.

#### VIII. Radicals and Square Roots

**Square Root:**
$$\sqrt{x}$$
> **Description:** Refers to the **principal (positive) square root**. Asks: "What non-negative number multiplied by itself equals $x$?"
> **Restriction:** For real numbers, the radicand ($x$) must be **non-negative** ($x \geq 0$).

**Cube Root:**
$$\sqrt[3]{x}$$
> **Description:** The inverse operation of cubing a number. Asks: "What number multiplied by itself three times equals $x$?"
> **Note:** The radicand ($x$) **can be negative** for cube roots.

**nth Root:**
$$\sqrt[n]{x}$$
> **Description:** The generalized radical form where $n$ is the **index** (or degree).
> **Note:** If $n$ is **even**, $x$ must be $\geq 0$. If $n$ is **odd**, $x$ can be any real number.

**Properties:**

$$\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$$
> **Description:** The square root of a perfect square is the **absolute value** of the term.
> **Reason:** This ensures the result is always positive, as the $\sqrt{}$ symbol means the principal (positive) root.

$$\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$$
> **Description:** The square root of a product can be split into the product of the square roots.
> **Usage:** This is the primary rule for **simplifying radicals** by factoring out the largest perfect square (e.g., $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 2} = 6\sqrt{2}$).

$$\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$$
> **Description:** The square root of a quotient can be split into the quotient of the square roots.
> **Usage:** Used in the process of **rationalizing the denominator** (ensuring no radical remains in the denominator).

$$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
> **Crucial Note:** This expression **cannot be simplified** to $a + b$. It is a common algebraic error to assume you can split the root across the addition sign.
> **Context:** This exact form appears inside the **Distance Formula**.

### 💡 Why Variables Cancel in a Fraction ($\frac{3x}{4x}$)

The process of "dropping" or canceling a variable in a fraction is based on two core algebraic rules: the definition of a fraction and the rules of exponents.

---

##### 1. The Multiplicative Identity (Cancellation)

The simplest explanation is that a fraction represents division, and **any non-zero quantity divided by itself equals 1** (the Multiplicative Identity).

$$\frac{3x}{4x} = \frac{3 \cdot x}{4 \cdot x} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{x}{x}$$

* Provided that $\mathbf{x \neq 0}$, the term $\mathbf{\frac{x}{x}}$ is equal to $\mathbf{1}$.
* Therefore, the expression simplifies to $\mathbf{\frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4}}$.

---

##### 2. The Quotient Rule for Exponents

The formal algebraic justification uses the Quotient Rule for Exponents: $\mathbf{\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}}$.

* In the expression $\mathbf{\frac{3x}{4x}}$, the terms $x$ in the numerator and denominator both have an implied exponent of $\mathbf{1}$.
$$\frac{3x^1}{4x^1} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{x^1}{x^1}$$

* Applying the Quotient Rule to the variables:
$$\frac{x^1}{x^1} = x^{1-1} = x^0$$

* The **Zero Exponent Rule** states that any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is **1** ($\mathbf{x^0 = 1}$).

* Substituting this back, we get:
$$\frac{3}{4} \cdot x^0 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4}$$

---

##### ⚠️ Key Restriction

**The Cancellation is only valid when the variable is non-zero.**

* You must state the restriction: $\mathbf{x \neq 0}$.
* If $\mathbf{x}$ were $0$, the original expression would be $\mathbf{\frac{3(0)}{4(0)} = \frac{0}{0}}$, which is an **indeterminate form** (and undefined division).


### Properties of Real Numbers

---

#### Commutative Property of Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a + b = b + a$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$5 + 8 = 8 + 5$$
    $$13 = 13$$
* **ROLE:** This property states that the **order** in which you add two or more numbers does **not** change the sum. You can swap the positions of the terms being added.

---

#### Commutative Property of Multiplication

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$6 \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot 6$$
    $$24 = 24$$
* **ROLE:** This property states that the **order** in which you multiply two or more factors does **not** change the product. You can swap the positions of the factors.

---

#### Associative Property of Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$(2 + 3) + 7 = 2 + (3 + 7)$$
    $$5 + 7 = 2 + 10$$
    $$12 = 12$$
* **WHAT CHANGES:** This property states that the way you **group** (using parentheses) three or more numbers being added does **not** change the sum. The order of the terms remains the same; only the grouping changes.

---

#### Associative Property of Multiplication

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$(5 \cdot 2) \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)$$
    $$10 \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot 8$$
    $$40 = 40$$
* **WHAT REMAINS THE SAME:** This property states that the way you **group** (using parentheses) three or more numbers being multiplied does **not** change the product. The order of the factors remains the same; only the grouping changes.

---

#### Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$4(3 + 5) = 4(3) + 4(5)$$
    $$4(8) = 12 + 20$$
    $$32 = 32$$
* **RELATIONSHIP:** This property connects multiplication and addition by showing that multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each term of the sum individually and then adding the products.
## Solving Equations :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=8m43s
### Solving Linear Equations

The primary goal of solving an algebraic equation is to **isolate the variable** (e.g., $\mathbf{x}$) to determine the value that makes the equation true.

The process relies on the **Properties of Equality**, which state that any mathematical operation applied to one side of the equation must also be applied to the other side to maintain balance.

#### Key Properties Used
* **Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality:** Used to move terms (variables or constants) across the equals sign.
* **Multiplication/Division Property of Equality:** Used to eliminate the coefficient and solve for the variable (e.g., dividing by $\mathbf{4}$ in $\mathbf{4x = 8}$).

#### Steps for Solving Equations

1.  **Simplify Both Sides**
    * **Distribute** to eliminate parentheses (e.g., $\mathbf{3(x + 2)}$).
    * **Combine like terms** (e.g., $\mathbf{5x - 2x}$).

2.  **Collect Variables**
    * Use addition or subtraction to move all **variable terms** ($\mathbf{x}$ terms) to one side of the equation (often the side that keeps the coefficient positive).
    * Move all **constant terms** (plain numbers) to the opposite side.

3.  **Isolate the Variable**
    * Use multiplication or division to make the coefficient of the variable equal to $\mathbf{1}$.
    * Example: To solve $\mathbf{4x = 12}$, divide both sides by $\mathbf{4}$:
        $$\mathbf{\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{12}{4} \implies x = 3}$$

4.  **Check Your Answer**
    * Substitute the final solution back into the **original equation** to ensure the left side equals the right side.

Anything you do on one side you have to do on the other

### Solving Linear Inequalities (when multiplying or dividing, flip the sign)

Solving linear inequalities in Algebra 1 follows the same basic steps as solving equations (using the properties of equality to isolate the variable), but with one critical rule change.

#### Primary Difference

* **Equations** ($\mathbf{=}$) result in a **single numerical solution** (e.g., $\mathbf{x = 5}$).
* **Inequalities** ($\mathbf{<, >, \le, \ge}$) result in a **range of values** (e.g., $\mathbf{x > 5}$).

#### The Critical Rule

The most important rule when solving inequalities is:

==You MUST reverse the direction of the inequality sign when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.==

#### Example of the Rule
Consider the inequality $\mathbf{-5x + 1 \ge 16}$:

1.  Subtract $\mathbf{1}$ from both sides:
    $$\mathbf{-5x \ge 15}$$

2.  Divide by $\mathbf{-5}$ and **reverse the sign** ($\mathbf{\ge}$ becomes $\mathbf{\le}$):
    $$\mathbf{\frac{-5x}{-5} \le \frac{15}{-5}}$$

3.  Simplify:
    $$\mathbf{x \le -3}$$

#### Graphing the Solution

The final solution is a range of numbers graphed on a number line. The type of circle used on the boundary point is determined by the inequality symbol.

#### Open vs. Closed Circles (Graphing Rules)

The circle type indicates whether the boundary number itself is part of the solution set:

* **Open Circle (Boundary NOT Included):**
    * Use for the "strict" inequalities: $\mathbf{<}$ (less than) or $\mathbf{>}$ (greater than).
    * The point is not a solution.

* **Closed Circle (Boundary IS Included):**
    * Use for the "inclusive" inequalities: $\mathbf{\le}$ (less than or equal to) or $\mathbf{\ge}$ (greater than or equal to).
    * The point is a solution.

The final solution ($\mathbf{x \le -3}$) can be represented on a number line:

* **Closed Circle** at $\mathbf{-3}$ (because of $\mathbf{\le}$, meaning $\mathbf{-3}$ is included).
* Shade to the **left** (representing all numbers less than or equal to $\mathbf{-3}$).

### Slope and Rate of Change 📈

Slope is a fundamental concept that measures the **steepness** and **direction** of a straight line. It is also known as the **Rate of Change** because it tells us how quickly the dependent variable ($\mathbf{y}$) changes relative to the independent variable ($\mathbf{x}$).

#### 1. The Slope Formula (Rise Over Run)

Slope is the ratio of the change in the vertical axis ($\mathbf{y}$) to the change in the horizontal axis ($\mathbf{x}$).

* **Verbal Formula:**
    $$\mathbf{\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{\text{Change in } y}{\text{Change in } x}}$$

* **Algebraic Formula:** Given any two points $\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$ and $\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$, the slope ($\mathbf{m}$) is:
    $$\mathbf{m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$$

#### 2. The Four Types of Slope

The sign and value of the slope indicate the line's behavior:

| Type | Direction (Left to Right) | Value of $\mathbf{m}$ | Example Line |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive** | **Rises** | $\mathbf{m > 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = 2x + 1}$ |
| **Negative** | **Falls** | $\mathbf{m < 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = -x + 5}$ |
| **Zero** | **Horizontal** (Flat) | $\mathbf{m = 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = 3}$ |
| **Undefined** | **Vertical** | $\mathbf{\text{Denominator is } 0}$ | $\mathbf{x = -2}$ |

#### 3. Slope in Context: Rate of Change

In word problems, the slope represents a rate and **must** include units.

* **Units:** Always "Units of $\mathbf{y}$ **per** Unit of $\mathbf{x}$."
    * Example: If $\mathbf{y}$ is cost and $\mathbf{x}$ is hours, the slope is the cost per hour.
* **Interpretation:** A **positive** slope means the quantity is increasing, and a **negative** slope means the quantity is decreasing.

#### 4. Importance in Linear Equations

The slope ($\mathbf{m}$) is the key component in the **Slope-Intercept Form**, which is used for graphing and analyzing linear relationships:

$$\mathbf{y = mx + b}$$

* $\mathbf{m}$ is the **slope** (rate of change).
* $\mathbf{b}$ is the **y-intercept** (the starting point/value when $\mathbf{x = 0}$).

### The Distance Formula 📏

The **Distance Formula** is used to find the straight-line length ($\mathbf{d}$) between any two points in a coordinate plane.

#### 1. Formula Derivation (Pythagorean Theorem)

The Distance Formula is derived directly from the **Pythagorean Theorem** ($\mathbf{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$).

* The distance $\mathbf{d}$ is the hypotenuse ($\mathbf{c}$).
* The difference in $\mathbf{x}$-coordinates ($\mathbf{x_2 - x_1}$) is one leg ($\mathbf{a}$).
* The difference in $\mathbf{y}$-coordinates ($\mathbf{y_2 - y_1}$) is the other leg ($\mathbf{b}$).

#### 2. The Formula

Given two points $\mathbf{P_1}$ at $\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$ and $\mathbf{P_2}$ at $\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$, the distance $\mathbf{d}$ is:

$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}}$$

#### 3. Steps for Calculation

1.  **Find the change in $\mathbf{x}$** and square the result: $\mathbf{(x_2 - x_1)^2}$.
2.  **Find the change in $\mathbf{y}$** and square the result: $\mathbf{(y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
3.  **Add** the two squared results.
4.  **Take the square root** of the sum to find $\mathbf{d}$.

#### 4. Example

To find the distance between $\mathbf{(1, 2)}$ and $\mathbf{(4, 6)}$:

$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{9 + 16}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{25}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = 5}$$
### Interval Notation

**Interval Notation** is a concise way to represent a set of **real numbers** that are solutions to an inequality. It uses parentheses and brackets to show whether the endpoints of the set are included or excluded.

---

#### 1. Key Symbols and Meanings

The choice between a parenthesis and a bracket is the most critical element, as it indicates the type of boundary.

| Symbol | Meaning | Inequality Symbol | Graphing Equivalent | Inclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parenthesis** $\mathbf{( \ )}$ | **Open** interval | $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Open Circle** ($\mathbf{\circ}$) | **NOT Included** |
| **Bracket** $\mathbf{[ \ ]}$ | **Closed** interval | $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Closed Circle** ($\mathbf{\bullet}$) | **IS Included** |

---

#### 2. The Infinity Rule

The concepts of **infinity** ($\mathbf{\infty}$) and **negative infinity** ($\mathbf{-\infty}$) represent bounds that the set approaches but never reaches.

* **Rule:** Infinity and negative infinity **ALWAYS** use a **parenthesis** $\mathbf{( \ )}$ in interval notation.
    * *Example:* $\mathbf{x > 5}$ is written as $\mathbf{(5, \infty)}$.

---

#### 3. Examples of Conversions

Here are common inequality types converted to interval notation:

| Inequality              | Graph Description                                                            | Interval Notation            |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{x > -2}$       | All numbers greater than $\mathbf{-2}$.                                      | $\mathbf{(-2, \infty)}$      |
| $\mathbf{x \le 7}$      | All numbers less than or equal to $\mathbf{7}$.                              | $\mathbf{(-\infty, 7]}$      |
| $\mathbf{-1 \le x < 4}$ | All numbers between $\mathbf{-1}$ and $\mathbf{4}$, including $\mathbf{-1}$. | $\mathbf{[-1, 4)}$           |
| **All Real Numbers**    | Entire number line.                                                          | $\mathbf{(-\infty, \infty)}$ |

### Graphing Linear Inequalities(shading, dash vs solid lines) 📝

Graphing a linear inequality involves representing the **range of solutions** on a coordinate plane, which requires two specific decisions: the **boundary line style** and the **shading direction**.

---

#### 1. The Boundary Line (Dashed vs. Solid)

The line itself is called the boundary. Its style depends on whether the inequality is strict or inclusive.

| Inequality Symbol | Line Style | Boundary Included? | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Dashed/Dotted** | **No** | Use when the points on the line are **NOT** solutions. |
| $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Solid** | **Yes** | Use when the points on the line **ARE** solutions. |

---

#### 2. Shading the Solution Area

Shading indicates the region of the plane that contains all the solutions.

#### A. Shading Rule (Quick Method for $\mathbf{y = mx + b}$ form)

If the inequality is already solved for $\mathbf{y}$:

* **Shade Above:** Use for **Greater Than** ($\mathbf{y >}$ or $\mathbf{y \ge}$).
* **Shade Below:** Use for **Less Than** ($\mathbf{y <}$ or $\mathbf{y \le}$).

#### B. The Test Point Method (Universal Check)

This method always works, especially for vertical/horizontal lines or complex inequalities:

1.  **Choose a Test Point:** Select a simple point **not on the line** (e.g., the origin, $\mathbf{(0, 0)}$).
2.  **Substitute:** Plug the test point's $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ values into the original inequality.
3.  **Shade Based on Result:**
    * **If TRUE:** Shade the region **containing** the test point.
    * **If FALSE:** Shade the region **not containing** the test point.
## Systems of Equations :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=36m10s
### Systems of Linear Equations/Inequalities 🧩

A **System of Linear Equations** is a set of two or more linear equations with the same set of variables (x and y). The **solution** is the ordered pair (x,y) that makes _all_ equations in the system true simultaneously.

---

#### 1. Methods for Solving Systems

There are three primary methods for solving systems of linear equations:

##### A. Substitution Method (Best when a variable is isolated)

1. **Isolate:** Solve one equation for one variable (e.g., y=…).
    
2. **Substitute:** Plug that expression into the _other_ equation.
    
3. **Solve** the resulting single-variable equation.
    
4. **Back-Substitute** the value to find the second variable.
    

**Example:**

{y=x+12x+y=7​

1. Substitute (x+1) for y in the second equation:
    
    2x+(x+1)=7
    
2. Solve for x: 3x+1=7→3x=6→x=2
    
3. Find y: y=2+1→y=3
    
4. **Solution:** (2,3)
    

---

##### B. Elimination Method (Best when in Standard Form Ax+By=C)

The goal is to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.

1. **Align:** Write both equations in **Standard Form**.
    
2. **Multiply (if needed):** Multiply one or both equations so that one variable has **opposite coefficients** (e.g., +4x and −4x).
    
3. **Add/Subtract** the equations to eliminate a variable.
    
4. **Solve & Back-Substitute** to find the values of x and y.
    

**Example:**

{3x+2y=8−3x+y=4​

1. The x coefficients (3 and −3) are opposites.
    
2. **Add** the equations: (3x+(−3x))+(2y+y)=8+4→3y=12
    
3. Solve for y: y=4
    
4. Find x: −3x+4=4→−3x=0→x=0
    
5. **Solution:** (0,4)
    

---

##### C. Graphing Method

1. **Convert:** Write both equations in **Slope-Intercept Form** (y=mx+b).
    
2. **Graph** both lines on the same coordinate plane.
    
3. The **intersection point** (x,y) is the solution.
    

---

#### 2. Types of Solutions (Algebraic and Graphical Outcomes)

| Algebraic Result                        | Graphical Result           | Number of Solutions           |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| x=number                                | **Intersecting Lines**     | **One Solution** (x,y)        |
| Variables cancel; False statement (3=5) | **Parallel Lines**         | **No Solution** (∅)           |
| Variables cancel; True statement (4=4)  | **Same Line** (Coincident) | **Infinitely Many Solutions** |
### Graphing Systems of Inequalities 📝

A **System of Linear Inequalities** is a set of two or more inequalities with the same variables. The **solution** to the system is the region on the coordinate plane where the shaded areas of all inequalities **overlap**.

---

#### 1. Graphing Each Boundary Line

For each inequality, treat it as an equation ($\mathbf{y = mx + b}$) to find the boundary line, but use the correct style based on the inequality symbol:

| Symbol | Line Style | Boundary Included? | Graphing Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Dashed/Dotted** | No | Used for **strict** inequalities. |
| $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Solid** | Yes | Used for **inclusive** inequalities. |

---

#### 2. Determining the Shading Region

The final solution is the area where *all* conditions are met.

**Method A: Quick Shading Rule (When y is isolated)**

* **Shade ABOVE:** For $\mathbf{y >}$ or $\mathbf{y \ge}$ (Greater Than).
* **Shade BELOW:** For $\mathbf{y <}$ or $\mathbf{y \le}$ (Less Than).

**Method B: The Test Point (Universal Check)**

1.  Pick a point **not on the line** (e.g., the origin $\mathbf{(0, 0)}$).
2.  Substitute $\mathbf{(x, y)}$ into the inequality.
3.  **If TRUE:** Shade the region **containing** the test point.
4.  **If FALSE:** Shade the region **not containing** the test point.

---

#### 3. The Solution to the System

1.  Graph the first inequality, including the correct line style and light shading.
2.  Graph the second inequality on the **same plane**, using the correct line style and shading.
3.  The **Solution Region** is the area where the two shaded regions **overlap** (often called the feasible region). This overlapping area is the *only* part that should be shaded darkly or highlighted as the final answer.

**Example:** Find the solution to the system:
$$\begin{cases} \mathbf{y > 2x - 1} & \text{(Line A)} \\ \mathbf{y \le -x + 4} & \text{(Line B)} \end{cases}$$

1.  **Line A ($\mathbf{y > 2x - 1}$):**
    * **Line:** Dashed (because of $\mathbf{>}$).
    * **Shading:** Above (because of $\mathbf{>}$).
2.  **Line B ($\mathbf{y \le -x + 4}$):**
    * **Line:** Solid (because of $\mathbf{\le}$).
    * **Shading:** Below (because of $\mathbf{\le}$).

The **solution** is the area that is **above the dashed line A** AND **below the solid line B**.
### Solving Absolute Value Equations 🎯

The **absolute value** ($\mathbf{|x|}$) of a number is its distance from zero. Since distance is always non-negative, the expression inside the bars must equal the target value ($\mathbf{c}$) OR its opposite ($\mathbf{-c}$).

---

#### 1. The Core Rule

To solve any absolute value equation of the form $\mathbf{|ax + b| = c}$, you **MUST** set up and solve two separate linear equations.

| Case | Equation | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive Case** | $\mathbf{ax + b = c}$ | The expression equals the positive distance. |
| **Negative Case** | $\mathbf{ax + b = -c}$ | The expression equals the negative distance. |

---

#### 2. Example A: Basic Two-Step Solve

Solve the equation: $\mathbf{|3x + 6| = 15}$

**Step 1: Set up both cases.**
* **Positive:** $\mathbf{3x + 6 = 15}$
* **Negative:** $\mathbf{3x + 6 = -15}$

**Step 2: Solve the Positive Case.**
$$\mathbf{3x + 6 = 15}$$
$$\mathbf{3x = 9}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 3}$$

**Step 3: Solve the Negative Case.**
$$\mathbf{3x + 6 = -15}$$
$$\mathbf{3x = -21}$$
$$\mathbf{x = -7}$$

**Solutions:** $\mathbf{x = 3}$ and $\mathbf{x = -7}$.

---

#### 3. Example B: Isolate the Absolute Value First

If there are numbers outside the absolute value bars, you **must isolate** the absolute value expression before setting up the two cases.

Solve the equation: $\mathbf{2|x - 5| + 3 = 13}$

**Step 1: Isolate the absolute value.**
$$\mathbf{2|x - 5| + 3 = 13}$$
$$\mathbf{2|x - 5| = 10}$$  (Subtract $\mathbf{3}$)
$$\mathbf{|x - 5| = 5}$$    (Divide by $\mathbf{2}$)

**Step 2: Set up and solve both cases.**

* **Positive:** $\mathbf{x - 5 = 5} \rightarrow \mathbf{x = 10}$
* **Negative:** $\mathbf{x - 5 = -5} \rightarrow \mathbf{x = 0}$

**Solutions:** $\mathbf{x = 10}$ and $\mathbf{x = 0}$.

---

#### 4. The No Solution Case (Important!)

If the absolute value expression is isolated and set equal to a **negative number**, there is **No Solution**.

* **Example:** $\mathbf{|x + 1| = -4}$
* **Reason:** ==An absolute value can never result in a negative number.==
## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=58m45s
### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Prime Factorization)

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** (also called the Unique Factorization Theorem) is a core concept in number theory and forms the basis for many algebraic techniques involving fractions, factoring, and least common multiples.

#### Definition

The theorem states that **every integer greater than 1** is either a **prime number** itself or can be represented as a **product of prime numbers**, and this representation is **unique** (except for the order of the factors).

- **Prime Number:** A whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
    
- **Composite Number:** A whole number greater than 1 that has more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10).
    

#### Procedure for Prime Factorization

The process of breaking a composite number down into its prime factors is called **Prime Factorization**. This is typically done using a **Factor Tree**.

**Example:** Find the prime factorization of the number **72**.

1. **Start:** Begin with the number 72. Find any two factors that multiply to 72 (e.g., 8 and 9).
    
    72=8×9
    
2. **Continue Factoring:** Break down the composite factors (8 and 9) until all branches end in a prime number.
    
    - Factor 8: 8=2×4. (2 is prime; 4 is composite).
        
    - Factor 4: 4=2×2. (Both 2s are prime).
        
    - Factor 9: 9=3×3. (Both 3s are prime).
        
3. **Collect Prime Factors:** Gather all the prime numbers at the ends of the branches: 2,2,2,3,3.
    
4. **Write the Final Prime Factorization:** Write the primes as a product, using exponents for repeated factors.
    
    72=2×2×2×3×3
    
    72=23×32
    

**Uniqueness:** No matter how you start the factor tree (e.g., 72=6×12 or 72=2×36), the final result will **always** be 23×32.
