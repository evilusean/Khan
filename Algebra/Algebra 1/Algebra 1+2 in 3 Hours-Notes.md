## 📝 Algebra 1 Essential Formulas: Detailed Explanations & Breakdowns

---

#### I. Linear Equations and Graphs

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
> **Description:** This formula calculates the **slope ($m$)** (or rate of change) of a line. The slope quantifies the **steepness and direction** of the line.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: Represents the slope, defined as the ratio of **Vertical Change (Rise)** to **Horizontal Change (Run)**.
> * $(y_2 - y_1)$: The change in the $y$-coordinates (Rise).
> * $(x_2 - x_1)$: The change in the $x$-coordinates (Run).
> **Usage:** Use this when given **two points** on a line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The order of subtraction must be consistent in both the numerator and the denominator.

**Slope-Intercept Form:**
$$y = mx + b$$
> **Description:** This is the most intuitive form for graphing a line. It defines $y$ as a function of $x$ based on the line's key properties.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: The **slope** (rate of change). A positive $m$ means the line rises from left to right; a negative $m$ means it falls.
> * $b$: The **$y$-intercept**. This is the specific point **$(0, b)$** where the line crosses the vertical $y$-axis.
> **Usage:** To graph the line, start at $b$ (the initial value), and then use $m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$ to find subsequent points. Also used to easily identify the properties of any linear function.

**Standard Form:**
$$Ax + By = C$$
> **Description:** A general form where the $x$ and $y$ variables are on the same side. $A$, $B$, and $C$ are typically required to be integers (whole numbers).
> **Breakdown:**
> * $A, B, C$: Integer coefficients and constant. This form is often used to model real-world problems involving limited resources (e.g., $Ax + By$ is the total cost).
> **Usage:** Most useful for solving **systems of linear equations** using the **Elimination Method** and for quickly finding the $x$ and $y$ intercepts by setting the opposite variable to zero.

**Point-Slope Form:**
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
> **Description:** This form allows you to write the equation of a line if you know the slope and only one point. It is derived directly from the Slope Formula.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: The slope.
> * $(x_1, y_1)$: A single, specific point on the line.
> * $(x, y)$: Represents any other point on the line.
> **Usage:** This is the best starting point when given a slope and a point. It can be algebraically rearranged (by distributing $m$ and adding $y_1$) to the Slope-Intercept Form.

**Distance Formula:**
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
> **Description:** Calculates the straight-line distance ($d$) between two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. It is a direct application of the **Pythagorean Theorem** ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) on the coordinate plane.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $(x_2 - x_1)^2$: Represents the square of the horizontal change ($\Delta x^2$).
> * $(y_2 - y_1)^2$: Represents the square of the vertical change ($\Delta y^2$).
> * The final square root gives you the hypotenuse length ($d$).
> **Usage:** Substitute the coordinates, perform the subtraction and squaring *first*, then add the results, and finally take the square root.

**Midpoint Formula:**
$$\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2},\ \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$
> **Description:** Finds the coordinates of the **exact center point** (midpoint) of the line segment connecting two endpoints.
> **Breakdown:**
> * The formula is essentially calculating the **average** (mean) of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates.
> **Usage:** Used to bisect a line segment or find the center of a figure (like the center of a circle from two points on its diameter).

**Parallel Lines:**
$$m_1 = m_2$$
> **Description:** Lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect.
> **Usage:** To be parallel, the lines **must have the exact same slope**.

**Perpendicular Lines:**
$$m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$$
> **Description:** Lines that intersect at a **$90^\circ$ (right) angle**.
> **Usage:** Their slopes must be **negative reciprocals**. (Take the original slope, flip the fraction, and change the sign). If $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, they are perpendicular.

---

#### II. Laws of Exponents

**Product Rule:**
$$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$
> **Description:** When multiplying exponential expressions with the **same base ($a$)**, you **add** the exponents.
> **Breakdown:** The rule works because you are simply counting the total factors being multiplied. Example: $x^2 \cdot x^3 = (x \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x) = x^5$.

**Quotient Rule:**
$$\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}$$
> **Description:** When dividing exponential expressions with the **same base ($a$)**, you **subtract** the exponent of the denominator ($m$) from the exponent of the numerator ($n$).
> **Breakdown:** The subtraction represents the cancellation of common factors in the numerator and denominator.

**Power of a Power Rule:**
$$(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$$
> **Description:** When an exponential term is raised to an external power, you **multiply** the exponents.
> **Breakdown:** Example: $(x^3)^2 = x^3 \cdot x^3$. Applying the Product Rule gives $x^{3+3} = x^6$, which is the same as $x^{3 \cdot 2}$.

**Zero Exponent Rule:**
$$a^0 = 1$$
> **Description:** Any non-zero base ($a$) raised to the power of zero is **always equal to 1**.
> **Breakdown:** This is derived from the Quotient Rule: $\frac{a^n}{a^n} = a^{n-n} = a^0$. Since any number divided by itself is 1, $a^0$ must be 1.

**Negative Exponent Rule:**
$$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$$
> **Description:** A term with a negative exponent is equal to the reciprocal of the term with a positive exponent.
> **Breakdown:** The negative sign dictates a move to the opposite side of the fraction bar (numerator $\leftrightarrow$ denominator) to change the sign of the exponent. Example: $\frac{1}{x^{-2}} = x^2$.

---

#### III. Polynomials and Factoring

**Difference of Squares:**
$$a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$$
> **Description:** This formula works in two ways: it's used to **factor** a binomial (left side to right side), or to quickly multiply two **conjugate binomials** (right side to left side).
> **Breakdown:** The middle terms ($+ab$ and $-ab$) cancel out when multiplying the conjugates, leaving only the difference of the squared terms.

**Perfect Square Trinomial 1:**
$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$$
> **Description:** The result of squaring a binomial with a plus sign.
> **Usage:** Used for factoring: if the first and last terms are perfect squares and the middle term is **twice the product** of their square roots, it's a perfect square trinomial.

**Perfect Square Trinomial 2:**
$$a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a-b)^2$$
> **Description:** The result of squaring a binomial with a minus sign.
> **Usage:** Used for factoring when the first and last terms are perfect squares and the middle term is **negative twice the product** of their square roots.

**FOIL Method:**
First, Outer, Inner, Last (for $$(a+b)(c+d)$$)
> **Description:** A systematic way to remember the four products necessary when **multiplying two binomials** (expressions with two terms).
> **Breakdown:** $\mathbf{F} = a \cdot c$; $\mathbf{O} = a \cdot d$; $\mathbf{I} = b \cdot c$; $\mathbf{L} = b \cdot d$. After multiplying, always combine the resulting $\mathbf{O}$ and $\mathbf{I}$ terms if they are like terms.

---

#### IV. Quadratic Equations

**Standard Form:**
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
> **Description:** The required form for a quadratic equation (a polynomial of degree 2, whose graph is a parabola). All terms are collected on one side, set equal to zero.
> **Breakdown:** $a$ is the leading coefficient (determines parabola's direction and width), $b$ is the linear coefficient, and $c$ is the constant term (the $y$-intercept).

**Quadratic Formula:**
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
> **Description:** A universal tool for finding the **roots** (solutions, zeros, or $x$-intercepts) of **any** quadratic equation in standard form.
> **Breakdown:**
> * The **$\pm$** sign is key: it indicates there are usually two solutions (or one repeated solution).
> * $(-b / 2a)$ is the axis of symmetry (and the $x$-coordinate of the vertex).
> * The entire $\pm \sqrt{\dots}$ part determines the distance from the axis of symmetry to the roots.

**Discriminant:**
$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
> **Description:** The expression **inside the square root** of the Quadratic Formula. It determines the nature and number of the roots without fully solving the equation.
> **Breakdown:**
> * If $\Delta > 0$ (positive): **Two distinct real solutions** (The parabola crosses the $x$-axis twice).
> * If $\Delta = 0$: **One real solution** (The parabola touches the $x$-axis at one point, the vertex).
> * If $\Delta < 0$ (negative): **No real solutions** (The parabola does not cross the $x$-axis).

**Vertex (x-coordinate):**
$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$
> **Description:** This formula finds the **$x$-coordinate** of the **vertex** of the parabola, which is the point of maximum or minimum value. This line is called the **axis of symmetry**.
> **Usage:** Substitute $a$ and $b$ from the standard form. Then, plug this resulting $x$-value back into the original quadratic equation to find the corresponding $y$-coordinate of the vertex.

---

#### V. Sequences

**Arithmetic Sequence (Explicit):**
$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$
> **Description:** This **Explicit Formula** allows you to calculate the value of **any term** ($a_n$) in a sequence where the terms increase or decrease by a **constant difference**.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $a_n$: The $n$-th term you want to find.
> * $a_1$: The value of the first term.
> * $n$: The term number (position in the sequence, e.g., 5th term is $n=5$).
> * $d$: The **common difference** (the amount added or subtracted each time).
> * $(n-1)d$: Represents the total distance traveled from the first term to the $n$-th term.

**Geometric Sequence (Explicit):**
$$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$
> **Description:** This **Explicit Formula** calculates the value of **any term** ($a_n$) in a sequence where the terms change by a **constant ratio** (multiplication).
> **Breakdown:**
> * $r$: The **common ratio** (the amount multiplied each time).
> * $r^{n-1}$: Represents the total times the ratio has been multiplied, starting after the first term.

---

#### VI. Inverse Functions

**Definition:**
If $f(x)$ is a function, its inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.
> **Description:** An inverse function, denoted $f^{-1}(x)$, is one that **undoes** the work of the original function $f(x)$.
> **Breakdown:** The process of applying the function and then its inverse (or vice-versa) results in the original input, $x$. Graphically, the inverse is the reflection of the original function across the line $y=x$.

**Finding the Inverse:**

1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$.
2. Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$.
3. Swap $x$ and $y$.
4. Write as $f^{-1}(x)$.

**Example:**
If $f(x) = 2x + 3$, then $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}$
> **Explanation:** This is the universal algebraic procedure for finding an inverse. **Step 3 (swapping $x$ and $y$)** is the fundamental mathematical action that defines the inverse relationship.

---
#### VII. Rational Functions & Variations

**Rational Function :** A function of the form:
$$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials and $Q(x) \neq 0$.
> **Description:** A function that is the ratio of two polynomials.
> **Breakdown:** The crucial mathematical restriction is that the **denominator $Q(x)$ can never equal zero** because division by zero is undefined. Setting $Q(x) = 0$ identifies values excluded from the domain, which are often the locations of **vertical asymptotes**.

**Direct Variation:**
$$y = kx \quad \text{or} \quad y \propto x$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies directly with $x$. This means $y$ is directly proportional to $x$.
> **Breakdown:** The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always a **constant ($k$)**, the **constant of variation**. As one variable increases, the other increases at the same rate. The graph is a straight line through the origin $(0,0)$.

**Inverse Variation:**
$$yx = k$$
$$y = \frac{k}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad y \propto \frac{1}{x}$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies inversely with $x$.
> **Breakdown:** The **product** $y \cdot x$ is always a **constant ($k$)**. As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases proportionally (and vice-versa). The graph is a hyperbola.

**Joint Variation:**
$$y = kxz$$
> **Description:** $y$ varies directly with **two or more** variables ($x$ and $z$).
> **Usage:** Use a given set of values for $y, x,$ and $z$ to solve for the constant $k$, and then write the complete variation equation.

**Combined Variation:**
$$y = \frac{kx}{z}$$
> **Description:** A relationship combining direct and inverse variation. $y$ varies **directly** with $x$ and **inversely** with $z$.

---
#### VIII. Radicals and Square Roots

**Square Root:**
$$\sqrt{x}$$
> **Description:** Refers to the **principal (positive) square root**. Asks: "What non-negative number multiplied by itself equals $x$?"
> **Restriction:** For real numbers, the radicand ($x$) must be **non-negative** ($x \geq 0$).

**Cube Root:**
$$\sqrt[3]{x}$$
> **Description:** The inverse operation of cubing a number. Asks: "What number multiplied by itself three times equals $x$?"
> **Note:** The radicand ($x$) **can be negative** for cube roots.

**nth Root:**
$$\sqrt[n]{x}$$
> **Description:** The generalized radical form where $n$ is the **index** (or degree).
> **Note:** If $n$ is **even**, $x$ must be $\geq 0$. If $n$ is **odd**, $x$ can be any real number.

**Properties:**

$$\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$$
> **Description:** The square root of a perfect square is the **absolute value** of the term.
> **Reason:** This ensures the result is always positive, as the $\sqrt{}$ symbol means the principal (positive) root.

$$\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$$
> **Description:** The square root of a product can be split into the product of the square roots.
> **Usage:** This is the primary rule for **simplifying radicals** by factoring out the largest perfect square (e.g., $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 2} = 6\sqrt{2}$).

$$\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$$
> **Description:** The square root of a quotient can be split into the quotient of the square roots.
> **Usage:** Used in the process of **rationalizing the denominator** (ensuring no radical remains in the denominator).

$$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
> **Crucial Note:** This expression **cannot be simplified** to $a + b$. It is a common algebraic error to assume you can split the root across the addition sign.
> **Context:** This exact form appears inside the **Distance Formula**.

### 💡 Why Variables Cancel in a Fraction ($\frac{3x}{4x}$)

The process of "dropping" or canceling a variable in a fraction is based on two core algebraic rules: the definition of a fraction and the rules of exponents.

---

##### 1. The Multiplicative Identity (Cancellation)

The simplest explanation is that a fraction represents division, and **any non-zero quantity divided by itself equals 1** (the Multiplicative Identity).

$$\frac{3x}{4x} = \frac{3 \cdot x}{4 \cdot x} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{x}{x}$$

* Provided that $\mathbf{x \neq 0}$, the term $\mathbf{\frac{x}{x}}$ is equal to $\mathbf{1}$.
* Therefore, the expression simplifies to $\mathbf{\frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4}}$.

---

##### 2. The Quotient Rule for Exponents

The formal algebraic justification uses the Quotient Rule for Exponents: $\mathbf{\frac{a^n}{a^m} = a^{n-m}}$.

* In the expression $\mathbf{\frac{3x}{4x}}$, the terms $x$ in the numerator and denominator both have an implied exponent of $\mathbf{1}$.
$$\frac{3x^1}{4x^1} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{x^1}{x^1}$$

* Applying the Quotient Rule to the variables:
$$\frac{x^1}{x^1} = x^{1-1} = x^0$$

* The **Zero Exponent Rule** states that any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is **1** ($\mathbf{x^0 = 1}$).

* Substituting this back, we get:
$$\frac{3}{4} \cdot x^0 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{4}$$

---

##### ⚠️ Key Restriction

**The Cancellation is only valid when the variable is non-zero.**

* You must state the restriction: $\mathbf{x \neq 0}$.
* If $\mathbf{x}$ were $0$, the original expression would be $\mathbf{\frac{3(0)}{4(0)} = \frac{0}{0}}$, which is an **indeterminate form** (and undefined division).


### Properties of Real Numbers

---

#### Commutative Property of Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a + b = b + a$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$5 + 8 = 8 + 5$$
    $$13 = 13$$
* **ROLE:** This property states that the **order** in which you add two or more numbers does **not** change the sum. You can swap the positions of the terms being added.

---

#### Commutative Property of Multiplication

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$6 \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot 6$$
    $$24 = 24$$
* **ROLE:** This property states that the **order** in which you multiply two or more factors does **not** change the product. You can swap the positions of the factors.

---

#### Associative Property of Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$(2 + 3) + 7 = 2 + (3 + 7)$$
    $$5 + 7 = 2 + 10$$
    $$12 = 12$$
* **WHAT CHANGES:** This property states that the way you **group** (using parentheses) three or more numbers being added does **not** change the sum. The order of the terms remains the same; only the grouping changes.

---

#### Associative Property of Multiplication

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$(5 \cdot 2) \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)$$
    $$10 \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot 8$$
    $$40 = 40$$
* **WHAT REMAINS THE SAME:** This property states that the way you **group** (using parentheses) three or more numbers being multiplied does **not** change the product. The order of the factors remains the same; only the grouping changes.

---

#### Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition

* **DEFINITION (Algebraic):**
    $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$
* **EXAMPLE (Numerical):**
    $$4(3 + 5) = 4(3) + 4(5)$$
    $$4(8) = 12 + 20$$
    $$32 = 32$$
* **RELATIONSHIP:** This property connects multiplication and addition by showing that multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each term of the sum individually and then adding the products.
## Solving Equations :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=8m43s
### Solving Linear Equations

The primary goal of solving an algebraic equation is to **isolate the variable** (e.g., $\mathbf{x}$) to determine the value that makes the equation true.

The process relies on the **Properties of Equality**, which state that any mathematical operation applied to one side of the equation must also be applied to the other side to maintain balance.

#### Key Properties Used
* **Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality:** Used to move terms (variables or constants) across the equals sign.
* **Multiplication/Division Property of Equality:** Used to eliminate the coefficient and solve for the variable (e.g., dividing by $\mathbf{4}$ in $\mathbf{4x = 8}$).

#### Steps for Solving Equations

1.  **Simplify Both Sides**
    * **Distribute** to eliminate parentheses (e.g., $\mathbf{3(x + 2)}$).
    * **Combine like terms** (e.g., $\mathbf{5x - 2x}$).

2.  **Collect Variables**
    * Use addition or subtraction to move all **variable terms** ($\mathbf{x}$ terms) to one side of the equation (often the side that keeps the coefficient positive).
    * Move all **constant terms** (plain numbers) to the opposite side.

3.  **Isolate the Variable**
    * Use multiplication or division to make the coefficient of the variable equal to $\mathbf{1}$.
    * Example: To solve $\mathbf{4x = 12}$, divide both sides by $\mathbf{4}$:
        $$\mathbf{\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{12}{4} \implies x = 3}$$

4.  **Check Your Answer**
    * Substitute the final solution back into the **original equation** to ensure the left side equals the right side.

Anything you do on one side you have to do on the other

### Solving Linear Inequalities (when multiplying or dividing, flip the sign)

Solving linear inequalities in Algebra 1 follows the same basic steps as solving equations (using the properties of equality to isolate the variable), but with one critical rule change.

#### Primary Difference

* **Equations** ($\mathbf{=}$) result in a **single numerical solution** (e.g., $\mathbf{x = 5}$).
* **Inequalities** ($\mathbf{<, >, \le, \ge}$) result in a **range of values** (e.g., $\mathbf{x > 5}$).

#### The Critical Rule

The most important rule when solving inequalities is:

==You MUST reverse the direction of the inequality sign when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.==

#### Example of the Rule
Consider the inequality $\mathbf{-5x + 1 \ge 16}$:

1.  Subtract $\mathbf{1}$ from both sides:
    $$\mathbf{-5x \ge 15}$$

2.  Divide by $\mathbf{-5}$ and **reverse the sign** ($\mathbf{\ge}$ becomes $\mathbf{\le}$):
    $$\mathbf{\frac{-5x}{-5} \le \frac{15}{-5}}$$

3.  Simplify:
    $$\mathbf{x \le -3}$$

#### Graphing the Solution

The final solution is a range of numbers graphed on a number line. The type of circle used on the boundary point is determined by the inequality symbol.

#### Open vs. Closed Circles (Graphing Rules)

The circle type indicates whether the boundary number itself is part of the solution set:

* **Open Circle (Boundary NOT Included):**
    * Use for the "strict" inequalities: $\mathbf{<}$ (less than) or $\mathbf{>}$ (greater than).
    * The point is not a solution.

* **Closed Circle (Boundary IS Included):**
    * Use for the "inclusive" inequalities: $\mathbf{\le}$ (less than or equal to) or $\mathbf{\ge}$ (greater than or equal to).
    * The point is a solution.

The final solution ($\mathbf{x \le -3}$) can be represented on a number line:

* **Closed Circle** at $\mathbf{-3}$ (because of $\mathbf{\le}$, meaning $\mathbf{-3}$ is included).
* Shade to the **left** (representing all numbers less than or equal to $\mathbf{-3}$).

### Slope and Rate of Change 📈

Slope is a fundamental concept that measures the **steepness** and **direction** of a straight line. It is also known as the **Rate of Change** because it tells us how quickly the dependent variable ($\mathbf{y}$) changes relative to the independent variable ($\mathbf{x}$).

#### 1. The Slope Formula (Rise Over Run)

Slope is the ratio of the change in the vertical axis ($\mathbf{y}$) to the change in the horizontal axis ($\mathbf{x}$).

* **Verbal Formula:**
    $$\mathbf{\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{\text{Change in } y}{\text{Change in } x}}$$

* **Algebraic Formula:** Given any two points $\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$ and $\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$, the slope ($\mathbf{m}$) is:
    $$\mathbf{m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$$

#### 2. The Four Types of Slope

The sign and value of the slope indicate the line's behavior:

| Type | Direction (Left to Right) | Value of $\mathbf{m}$ | Example Line |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive** | **Rises** | $\mathbf{m > 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = 2x + 1}$ |
| **Negative** | **Falls** | $\mathbf{m < 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = -x + 5}$ |
| **Zero** | **Horizontal** (Flat) | $\mathbf{m = 0}$ | $\mathbf{y = 3}$ |
| **Undefined** | **Vertical** | $\mathbf{\text{Denominator is } 0}$ | $\mathbf{x = -2}$ |

#### 3. Slope in Context: Rate of Change

In word problems, the slope represents a rate and **must** include units.

* **Units:** Always "Units of $\mathbf{y}$ **per** Unit of $\mathbf{x}$."
    * Example: If $\mathbf{y}$ is cost and $\mathbf{x}$ is hours, the slope is the cost per hour.
* **Interpretation:** A **positive** slope means the quantity is increasing, and a **negative** slope means the quantity is decreasing.

#### 4. Importance in Linear Equations

The slope ($\mathbf{m}$) is the key component in the **Slope-Intercept Form**, which is used for graphing and analyzing linear relationships:

$$\mathbf{y = mx + b}$$

* $\mathbf{m}$ is the **slope** (rate of change).
* $\mathbf{b}$ is the **y-intercept** (the starting point/value when $\mathbf{x = 0}$).

### The Distance Formula 📏

The **Distance Formula** is used to find the straight-line length ($\mathbf{d}$) between any two points in a coordinate plane.

#### 1. Formula Derivation (Pythagorean Theorem)

The Distance Formula is derived directly from the **Pythagorean Theorem** ($\mathbf{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$).

* The distance $\mathbf{d}$ is the hypotenuse ($\mathbf{c}$).
* The difference in $\mathbf{x}$-coordinates ($\mathbf{x_2 - x_1}$) is one leg ($\mathbf{a}$).
* The difference in $\mathbf{y}$-coordinates ($\mathbf{y_2 - y_1}$) is the other leg ($\mathbf{b}$).

#### 2. The Formula

Given two points $\mathbf{P_1}$ at $\mathbf{(x_1, y_1)}$ and $\mathbf{P_2}$ at $\mathbf{(x_2, y_2)}$, the distance $\mathbf{d}$ is:

$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}}$$

#### 3. Steps for Calculation

1.  **Find the change in $\mathbf{x}$** and square the result: $\mathbf{(x_2 - x_1)^2}$.
2.  **Find the change in $\mathbf{y}$** and square the result: $\mathbf{(y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
3.  **Add** the two squared results.
4.  **Take the square root** of the sum to find $\mathbf{d}$.

#### 4. Example

To find the distance between $\mathbf{(1, 2)}$ and $\mathbf{(4, 6)}$:

$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{9 + 16}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = \sqrt{25}}$$
$$\mathbf{d = 5}$$
### Interval Notation

**Interval Notation** is a concise way to represent a set of **real numbers** that are solutions to an inequality. It uses parentheses and brackets to show whether the endpoints of the set are included or excluded.

---

#### 1. Key Symbols and Meanings

The choice between a parenthesis and a bracket is the most critical element, as it indicates the type of boundary.

| Symbol | Meaning | Inequality Symbol | Graphing Equivalent | Inclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parenthesis** $\mathbf{( \ )}$ | **Open** interval | $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Open Circle** ($\mathbf{\circ}$) | **NOT Included** |
| **Bracket** $\mathbf{[ \ ]}$ | **Closed** interval | $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Closed Circle** ($\mathbf{\bullet}$) | **IS Included** |

---

#### 2. The Infinity Rule

The concepts of **infinity** ($\mathbf{\infty}$) and **negative infinity** ($\mathbf{-\infty}$) represent bounds that the set approaches but never reaches.

* **Rule:** Infinity and negative infinity **ALWAYS** use a **parenthesis** $\mathbf{( \ )}$ in interval notation.
    * *Example:* $\mathbf{x > 5}$ is written as $\mathbf{(5, \infty)}$.

---

#### 3. Examples of Conversions

Here are common inequality types converted to interval notation:

| Inequality              | Graph Description                                                            | Interval Notation            |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{x > -2}$       | All numbers greater than $\mathbf{-2}$.                                      | $\mathbf{(-2, \infty)}$      |
| $\mathbf{x \le 7}$      | All numbers less than or equal to $\mathbf{7}$.                              | $\mathbf{(-\infty, 7]}$      |
| $\mathbf{-1 \le x < 4}$ | All numbers between $\mathbf{-1}$ and $\mathbf{4}$, including $\mathbf{-1}$. | $\mathbf{[-1, 4)}$           |
| **All Real Numbers**    | Entire number line.                                                          | $\mathbf{(-\infty, \infty)}$ |

### Graphing Linear Inequalities(shading, dash vs solid lines) 📝

Graphing a linear inequality involves representing the **range of solutions** on a coordinate plane, which requires two specific decisions: the **boundary line style** and the **shading direction**.

---

#### 1. The Boundary Line (Dashed vs. Solid)

The line itself is called the boundary. Its style depends on whether the inequality is strict or inclusive.

| Inequality Symbol | Line Style | Boundary Included? | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Dashed/Dotted** | **No** | Use when the points on the line are **NOT** solutions. |
| $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Solid** | **Yes** | Use when the points on the line **ARE** solutions. |

---

#### 2. Shading the Solution Area

Shading indicates the region of the plane that contains all the solutions.

#### A. Shading Rule (Quick Method for $\mathbf{y = mx + b}$ form)

If the inequality is already solved for $\mathbf{y}$:

* **Shade Above:** Use for **Greater Than** ($\mathbf{y >}$ or $\mathbf{y \ge}$).
* **Shade Below:** Use for **Less Than** ($\mathbf{y <}$ or $\mathbf{y \le}$).

#### B. The Test Point Method (Universal Check)

This method always works, especially for vertical/horizontal lines or complex inequalities:

1.  **Choose a Test Point:** Select a simple point **not on the line** (e.g., the origin, $\mathbf{(0, 0)}$).
2.  **Substitute:** Plug the test point's $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ values into the original inequality.
3.  **Shade Based on Result:**
    * **If TRUE:** Shade the region **containing** the test point.
    * **If FALSE:** Shade the region **not containing** the test point.
## Systems of Equations :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=36m10s
### Systems of Linear Equations/Inequalities 🧩

A **System of Linear Equations** is a set of two or more linear equations with the same set of variables (x and y). The **solution** is the ordered pair (x,y) that makes _all_ equations in the system true simultaneously.

---

#### 1. Methods for Solving Systems

There are three primary methods for solving systems of linear equations:

##### A. Substitution Method (Best when a variable is isolated)

1. **Isolate:** Solve one equation for one variable (e.g., y=…).
    
2. **Substitute:** Plug that expression into the _other_ equation.
    
3. **Solve** the resulting single-variable equation.
    
4. **Back-Substitute** the value to find the second variable.
    

**Example:**

{y=x+12x+y=7​

1. Substitute (x+1) for y in the second equation:
    
    2x+(x+1)=7
    
2. Solve for x: 3x+1=7→3x=6→x=2
    
3. Find y: y=2+1→y=3
    
4. **Solution:** (2,3)
    

---

##### B. Elimination Method (Best when in Standard Form Ax+By=C)

The goal is to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.

1. **Align:** Write both equations in **Standard Form**.
    
2. **Multiply (if needed):** Multiply one or both equations so that one variable has **opposite coefficients** (e.g., +4x and −4x).
    
3. **Add/Subtract** the equations to eliminate a variable.
    
4. **Solve & Back-Substitute** to find the values of x and y.
    

**Example:**

{3x+2y=8−3x+y=4​

1. The x coefficients (3 and −3) are opposites.
    
2. **Add** the equations: (3x+(−3x))+(2y+y)=8+4→3y=12
    
3. Solve for y: y=4
    
4. Find x: −3x+4=4→−3x=0→x=0
    
5. **Solution:** (0,4)
    

---

##### C. Graphing Method

1. **Convert:** Write both equations in **Slope-Intercept Form** (y=mx+b).
    
2. **Graph** both lines on the same coordinate plane.
    
3. The **intersection point** (x,y) is the solution.
    

---

#### 2. Types of Solutions (Algebraic and Graphical Outcomes)

| Algebraic Result                        | Graphical Result           | Number of Solutions           |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| x=number                                | **Intersecting Lines**     | **One Solution** (x,y)        |
| Variables cancel; False statement (3=5) | **Parallel Lines**         | **No Solution** (∅)           |
| Variables cancel; True statement (4=4)  | **Same Line** (Coincident) | **Infinitely Many Solutions** |
### Graphing Systems of Inequalities 📝

A **System of Linear Inequalities** is a set of two or more inequalities with the same variables. The **solution** to the system is the region on the coordinate plane where the shaded areas of all inequalities **overlap**.

---

#### 1. Graphing Each Boundary Line

For each inequality, treat it as an equation ($\mathbf{y = mx + b}$) to find the boundary line, but use the correct style based on the inequality symbol:

| Symbol | Line Style | Boundary Included? | Graphing Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{<}$ or $\mathbf{>}$ | **Dashed/Dotted** | No | Used for **strict** inequalities. |
| $\mathbf{\le}$ or $\mathbf{\ge}$ | **Solid** | Yes | Used for **inclusive** inequalities. |

---

#### 2. Determining the Shading Region

The final solution is the area where *all* conditions are met.

**Method A: Quick Shading Rule (When y is isolated)**

* **Shade ABOVE:** For $\mathbf{y >}$ or $\mathbf{y \ge}$ (Greater Than).
* **Shade BELOW:** For $\mathbf{y <}$ or $\mathbf{y \le}$ (Less Than).

**Method B: The Test Point (Universal Check)**

1.  Pick a point **not on the line** (e.g., the origin $\mathbf{(0, 0)}$).
2.  Substitute $\mathbf{(x, y)}$ into the inequality.
3.  **If TRUE:** Shade the region **containing** the test point.
4.  **If FALSE:** Shade the region **not containing** the test point.

---

#### 3. The Solution to the System

1.  Graph the first inequality, including the correct line style and light shading.
2.  Graph the second inequality on the **same plane**, using the correct line style and shading.
3.  The **Solution Region** is the area where the two shaded regions **overlap** (often called the feasible region). This overlapping area is the *only* part that should be shaded darkly or highlighted as the final answer.

**Example:** Find the solution to the system:
$$\begin{cases} \mathbf{y > 2x - 1} & \text{(Line A)} \\ \mathbf{y \le -x + 4} & \text{(Line B)} \end{cases}$$

1.  **Line A ($\mathbf{y > 2x - 1}$):**
    * **Line:** Dashed (because of $\mathbf{>}$).
    * **Shading:** Above (because of $\mathbf{>}$).
2.  **Line B ($\mathbf{y \le -x + 4}$):**
    * **Line:** Solid (because of $\mathbf{\le}$).
    * **Shading:** Below (because of $\mathbf{\le}$).

The **solution** is the area that is **above the dashed line A** AND **below the solid line B**.
### Solving Absolute Value Equations 🎯

The **absolute value** ($\mathbf{|x|}$) of a number is its distance from zero. Since distance is always non-negative, the expression inside the bars must equal the target value ($\mathbf{c}$) OR its opposite ($\mathbf{-c}$).

---

#### 1. The Core Rule

To solve any absolute value equation of the form $\mathbf{|ax + b| = c}$, you **MUST** set up and solve two separate linear equations.

| Case | Equation | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Positive Case** | $\mathbf{ax + b = c}$ | The expression equals the positive distance. |
| **Negative Case** | $\mathbf{ax + b = -c}$ | The expression equals the negative distance. |

---

#### 2. Example A: Basic Two-Step Solve

Solve the equation: $\mathbf{|3x + 6| = 15}$

**Step 1: Set up both cases.**
* **Positive:** $\mathbf{3x + 6 = 15}$
* **Negative:** $\mathbf{3x + 6 = -15}$

**Step 2: Solve the Positive Case.**
$$\mathbf{3x + 6 = 15}$$
$$\mathbf{3x = 9}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 3}$$

**Step 3: Solve the Negative Case.**
$$\mathbf{3x + 6 = -15}$$
$$\mathbf{3x = -21}$$
$$\mathbf{x = -7}$$

**Solutions:** $\mathbf{x = 3}$ and $\mathbf{x = -7}$.

---

#### 3. Example B: Isolate the Absolute Value First

If there are numbers outside the absolute value bars, you **must isolate** the absolute value expression before setting up the two cases.

Solve the equation: $\mathbf{2|x - 5| + 3 = 13}$

**Step 1: Isolate the absolute value.**
$$\mathbf{2|x - 5| + 3 = 13}$$
$$\mathbf{2|x - 5| = 10}$$  (Subtract $\mathbf{3}$)
$$\mathbf{|x - 5| = 5}$$    (Divide by $\mathbf{2}$)

**Step 2: Set up and solve both cases.**

* **Positive:** $\mathbf{x - 5 = 5} \rightarrow \mathbf{x = 10}$
* **Negative:** $\mathbf{x - 5 = -5} \rightarrow \mathbf{x = 0}$

**Solutions:** $\mathbf{x = 10}$ and $\mathbf{x = 0}$.

---

#### 4. The No Solution Case (Important!)

If the absolute value expression is isolated and set equal to a **negative number**, there is **No Solution**.

* **Example:** $\mathbf{|x + 1| = -4}$
* **Reason:** ==An absolute value can never result in a negative number.==
## Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=58m45s
### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Prime Factorization)

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** (also called the Unique Factorization Theorem) is a core concept in number theory and forms the basis for many algebraic techniques involving fractions, factoring, and least common multiples.

---

#### Definition

The theorem states that **every integer greater than 1** is either a **prime number** itself or can be represented as a **product of prime numbers**, and this representation is **unique** (except for the order of the factors).

* **Prime Number:** A whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
* **Composite Number:** A whole number greater than 1 that has more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10).

---

#### Procedure for Prime Factorization

The process of breaking a composite number down into its prime factors is called **Prime Factorization**. This is typically done using a **Factor Tree**.

**Example:** Find the prime factorization of the number **72**.

1.  **Start:** Begin with the number $\mathbf{72}$. Find any two factors that multiply to $\mathbf{72}$ (e.g., $\mathbf{8}$ and $\mathbf{9}$).
    $$\mathbf{72 = 8 \times 9}$$

2.  **Continue Factoring:** Break down the composite factors until all branches end in a prime number.
    * Factor $\mathbf{8}$: $\mathbf{8 = 2 \times 4}$
    * Factor $\mathbf{4}$: $\mathbf{4 = 2 \times 2}$
    * Factor $\mathbf{9}$: $\mathbf{9 = 3 \times 3}$

3.  **Collect Prime Factors:** Gather all the prime numbers: $\mathbf{2, 2, 2, 3, 3}$.

4.  **Write the Final Prime Factorization (Using Exponents):**
    $$\mathbf{72 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3}$$
    $$\mathbf{72 = 2^3 \times 3^2}$$

**Uniqueness:** No matter how you start the factor tree, the final unique result will **always** be $\mathbf{2^3 \times 3^2}$.

### Greatest Common Factor (GCF) 🎯

The **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** of two or more integers is the **largest positive integer** that divides into each of the numbers without leaving a remainder.

---

#### 1. Definition and Use

* **Definition:** The largest number that is a factor of every number in a given set.
* **Primary Use in Algebra:** GCF is essential for **simplifying fractions** and performing **polynomial factoring** (e.g., Factoring out the GCF).

---

#### 2. Method: Prime Factorization

The most reliable method for finding the GCF is breaking down the numbers into their prime components.

1.  **Prime Factorization:** Find the prime factorization of each number, writing the result using exponents.
2.  **Identify Common Primes:** List only the prime factors that **all** numbers share.
3.  **Use Lowest Exponent:** For each common prime factor, choose the **lowest power** (exponent) that appears in any of the factorizations.
4.  **Multiply:** Multiply these common factors (raised to their lowest powers) to get the GCF.

---

#### 3. Example

Find the GCF of $\mathbf{54}$ and $\mathbf{90}$.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**
* $$\mathbf{54 = 2^1 \times 3^3}$$
* $$\mathbf{90 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1}$$

**Step 2 & 3: Identify Common Factors with Lowest Exponents**
* **Common Prime 2:** Both have $\mathbf{2^1}$. (Lowest is $\mathbf{2^1}$).
* **Common Prime 3:** Exponents are $\mathbf{3^3}$ and $\mathbf{3^2}$. (Lowest is $\mathbf{3^2}$).
* (5 is not common, so it is ignored).

**Step 4: Calculate the GCF**
$$\mathbf{GCF} = 2^1 \times 3^2$$
$$\mathbf{GCF} = 2 \times 9$$
$$\mathbf{GCF = 18}$$
### Polynomials and Exponent Rules 💡

A **Polynomial** is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients that involves only the operations of **addition, subtraction, multiplication**, and **non-negative integer exponents** of variables.

---

#### 1. Fundamental Exponent Rules (Simplifying Polynomials)

These rules are used to simplify polynomials, especially when multiplying or dividing terms with the same base ($\mathbf{x}$).

| Rule Name | Rule | Example | Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Rule** (Multiplying) | $\mathbf{x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}}$ | $\mathbf{x^3 \cdot x^5 = x^{3+5} = x^8}$ | When bases are multiplied, **add** the exponents. |
| **Quotient Rule** (Dividing) | $\mathbf{\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}}$ | $\mathbf{\frac{x^7}{x^3} = x^{7-3} = x^4}$ | When bases are divided, **subtract** the exponents. |
| **Power Rule** | $\mathbf{(x^a)^b = x^{a \cdot b}}$ | $\mathbf{(x^4)^2 = x^{4 \cdot 2} = x^8}$ | Raise a power to a power by **multiplying** the exponents. |

---

#### 2. Special Exponent Rules (Zero and Negative Exponents)

These rules define how to handle special cases that arise from the Quotient Rule.

**A. Zero Exponent Rule**

* **Rule:** Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero equals **1**.
* $$\mathbf{x^0 = 1}$$
* **Derivation Example:**
    $$\mathbf{\frac{x^a}{x^a} = x^{a-a} = x^0}$$
    Since any non-zero number divided by itself is $\mathbf{1}$, it follows that:
    $$\mathbf{\frac{x^a}{x^a} = 1}$$
    Therefore, $\mathbf{x^0 = 1}$.

**B. Negative Exponent Rule**

* **Rule:** A negative exponent indicates the **reciprocal** of the base raised to the positive exponent. Negative exponents **do not** make the overall expression negative.
* $$\mathbf{x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a}}$$
* **Derivation Example:**
    $$\mathbf{\frac{x^3}{x^5} = x^{3-5} = x^{-2}}$$
    $$\mathbf{\frac{x^3}{x^5} = \frac{x \cdot x \cdot x}{x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x} = \frac{1}{x \cdot x} = \frac{1}{x^2}}$$
    Therefore, $\mathbf{x^{-2} = \frac{1}{x^2}}$.

---

#### 3. Combining Rules (Multiplication and Reciprocal)

The following two expressions are equivalent ways of showing a term multiplied by its reciprocal, illustrating how the exponent rules simplify to $\mathbf{1}$.

* $$\mathbf{x^a \cdot \frac{1}{x^a} = x^a \cdot x^{-a} = x^{a + (-a)} = x^0 = 1}$$
* $$\mathbf{x^{a-a} = x^0 = 1}$$

---

#### 4. Simplifying Polynomials Example

Simplify the expression: $\mathbf{(3x^2y^4) \cdot (2x^3y^{-1})}$

1.  **Group Coefficients and Bases:**
    $$\mathbf{(3 \cdot 2) \cdot (x^2 \cdot x^3) \cdot (y^4 \cdot y^{-1})}$$

2.  **Apply Product Rule to Bases:**
    $$\mathbf{6 \cdot x^{2+3} \cdot y^{4+(-1)}}$$

3.  **Simplify Exponents:**
    $$\mathbf{6x^5y^3}$$
###  Radicals and Perfect Squares (Simplifying Roots) 🔲

A **Radical Expression** is an expression that contains a square root symbol ($\mathbf{\sqrt{}}$). The goal in algebra is to **simplify** the radical as much as possible.

#### 1. Defining Radical Expressions

A **Radical Expression** is any expression containing a root symbol ($\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{}}$).

* **The Radical Symbol** ($\mathbf{\sqrt{\hphantom{x}}}$): This is the primary symbol.
* **Index ($\mathbf{n}$):** The small number placed outside the radical symbol ($\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{}}$) indicating which root to take (square root, cube root, etc.). If no number is present, the index is assumed to be $\mathbf{2}$ (square root).
* **Radicand ($\mathbf{x}$):** The term or expression placed inside the radical symbol.
    $$\text{Example: } \mathbf{\sqrt[n]{x} \rightarrow \text{Index is } n, \text{Radicand is } x}$$

---

#### 2. Fundamental Exponent Rules (Simplification)

These rules apply when multiplying, dividing, or raising terms with the same base ($\mathbf{x}$).

| Rule Name | Rule | Example | Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Rule** | $\mathbf{x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}}$ | $\mathbf{x^3 \cdot x^5 = x^8}$ | **Add** exponents when multiplying bases. |
| **Quotient Rule** | $\mathbf{\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}}$ | $\mathbf{\frac{x^7}{x^3} = x^4}$ | **Subtract** exponents when dividing bases. |
| **Power Rule** | $\mathbf{(x^a)^b = x^{a \cdot b}}$ | $\mathbf{(x^4)^2 = x^8}$ | **Multiply** exponents when raising a power to a power. |

---

#### 3. Special Exponent Rules

These rules define the behavior of zero and negative exponents.

| Rule Name | Rule | Example | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero Exponent** | $\mathbf{x^0 = 1}$ ($\mathbf{x \neq 0}$) | $\mathbf{5^0 = 1}$ | Derives from the Quotient Rule: $\mathbf{x^{a-a} = \frac{x^a}{x^a} = 1}$. |
| **Negative Exponent** | $\mathbf{x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a}}$ | $\mathbf{x^{-4} = \frac{1}{x^4}}$ | A negative exponent means to take the **reciprocal** and make the exponent positive. |

**Important Consequences:**
* $\mathbf{x^a \cdot x^{-a} = x^{a-a} = x^0 = 1}$ (A term times its reciprocal always equals 1).
* Negative exponents **DO NOT** make the number itself negative. $\mathbf{2^{-3} = 1/8}$, not $-8$.

---

#### 4. Radicals and Rational Exponents

Radicals and fractional exponents are two ways of writing the same thing. This connection is used for simplification.

**A. Rational Exponent Rule**

* **Rule:** $$\mathbf{x^{a/b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}}$$
    * The **Denominator ($\mathbf{b}$)** is the **root (index)**.
    * The **Numerator ($\mathbf{a}$)** is the **power (exponent)**.
* **Unit Fraction Case:** $$\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{1/n}}$$ (Used for solving roots).

**B. Perfect Powers and Simplification**

A **perfect square** is a number whose square root is an integer (e.g., $\mathbf{4, 9, 16}$). When simplifying $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{x^a}}$, we look for exponents ($\mathbf{a}$) that are divisible by the index ($\mathbf{n}$).

| Type | Condition | Example (Simplification) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Perfect Square ($\mathbf{n=2}$)** | Exponent is **even**. | $\mathbf{\sqrt{x^{10}} = x^{10/2} = x^5}$ |
| **Perfect Cube ($\mathbf{n=3}$)** | Exponent is divisible by **3**. | $\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{y^{12}} = y^{12/3} = y^4}$ |

**Example: Full Simplification**

Simplify $\mathbf{\sqrt{72x^5}}$.

1.  **Factor into Perfect Squares:**
    $$\mathbf{\sqrt{72x^5} = \sqrt{(36 \cdot 2) \cdot (x^4 \cdot x)}}$$
2.  **Separate Perfect Roots:**
    $$\mathbf{\sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} \cdot \sqrt{2x}}$$
3.  **Simplify:** ($\mathbf{\sqrt{36} = 6}$ and $\mathbf{\sqrt{x^4} = x^{4/2} = x^2}$)
    $$\mathbf{6 \cdot x^2 \cdot \sqrt{2x}}$$
4.  **Final Answer:** $$\mathbf{6x^2\sqrt{2x}}$$

### 1. Perfect Squares (The Foundation)

A **perfect square** is the result of multiplying an integer by itself. Recognizing these numbers is key to simplifying radicals.

| Integer ($\mathbf{n}$) | Perfect Square ($\mathbf{n^2}$) | Square Root ($\mathbf{\sqrt{n^2}}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{1}$ |
| $\mathbf{2}$ | $\mathbf{4}$ | $\mathbf{2}$ |
| $\mathbf{3}$ | $\mathbf{9}$ | $\mathbf{3}$ |
| $\mathbf{4}$ | $\mathbf{16}$ | $\mathbf{4}$ |
| $\mathbf{5}$ | $\mathbf{25}$ | $\mathbf{5}$ |
| $\mathbf{10}$ | $\mathbf{100}$ | $\mathbf{10}$ |
| $\mathbf{12}$ | $\mathbf{144}$ | $\mathbf{12}$ |

#### 2. Simplifying Radical Expressions

The **Product Rule for Radicals** states that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots: $\mathbf{\sqrt{a \cdot b} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}}$.

To simplify $\mathbf{\sqrt{N}}$, find the largest factor of $\mathbf{N}$ that is a perfect square.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Factor:** Find the **largest perfect square factor** of the number inside the radical ($\mathbf{N}$).
2.  **Separate:** Rewrite the radical as the product of the square root of the perfect square and the square root of the remaining factor.
3.  **Simplify:** Take the square root of the perfect square factor and leave the remainder under the radical.

**Example 1: Numerical Simplification**

Simplify $\mathbf{\sqrt{50}}$.

1.  **Largest Perfect Square Factor:** The largest perfect square that divides $\mathbf{50}$ is $\mathbf{25}$.
2.  **Separate:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 2}}$
3.  **Simplify:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{25} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}}$

**Example 2: Simplification with Variables**

The square root of a variable with an exponent is simplified by dividing the exponent by $\mathbf{2}$.

Simplify $\mathbf{\sqrt{x^7}}$.

1.  **Identify Largest Even Power:** The largest perfect square factor of $\mathbf{x^7}$ is $\mathbf{x^6}$ (since $6$ is the largest even number less than $7$).
2.  **Separate:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{x^7} = \sqrt{x^6 \cdot x^1}}$
3.  **Simplify:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{x^6} \cdot \sqrt{x} = x^3\sqrt{x}}$

**Example 3: Combined Simplification**

Simplify $\mathbf{\sqrt{72x^5}}$.

1.  **Factor:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{72x^5} = \sqrt{(36 \cdot 2) \cdot (x^4 \cdot x)}}$
2.  **Separate Perfect Squares:** $\mathbf{\sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} \cdot \sqrt{2x}}$
3.  **Simplify:** $\mathbf{6 \cdot x^2 \cdot \sqrt{2x}}$
4.  **Final Answer:** $\mathbf{6x^2\sqrt{2x}}$

### Multiplying Polynomials (FOIL & Distribution) ✖️

Multiplying polynomials involves ensuring **every term** in the first polynomial is multiplied by **every term** in the second polynomial.

---

#### 1. The FOIL Method (For Binomials Only)

The **FOIL** method is a mnemonic used specifically for multiplying two **binomials** (polynomials with two terms).

* **F**irst: Multiply the **F**irst terms of each binomial.
* **O**uter: Multiply the **O**uter (outside) terms.
* **I**nner: Multiply the **I**nner (inside) terms.
* **L**ast: Multiply the **L**ast terms of each binomial.

**Example A: Simple Binomial Multiplication**

Solve: $\mathbf{(x - 4)(x - 4)}$

1.  **F**irst: $\mathbf{x \cdot x = x^2}$
2.  **O**uter: $\mathbf{x \cdot (-4) = -4x}$
3.  **I**nner: $\mathbf{(-4) \cdot x = -4x}$
4.  **L**ast: $\mathbf{(-4) \cdot (-4) = +16}$
5.  **Combine Like Terms:** $\mathbf{x^2 - 4x - 4x + 16}$
6.  **Final Answer:** $\mathbf{x^2 - 8x + 16}$
    *(Note: This is a Perfect Square Trinomial, which is the result of 'Completing the Square').*

**Example B: Binomials with Coefficients**

Solve: $\mathbf{(y - 1)(2y + 3)}$

1.  **F**irst: $\mathbf{y \cdot 2y = 2y^2}$
2.  **O**uter: $\mathbf{y \cdot (+3) = +3y}$
3.  **I**nner: $\mathbf{(-1) \cdot 2y = -2y}$
4.  **L**ast: $\mathbf{(-1) \cdot (+3) = -3}$
5.  **Combine Like Terms:** $\mathbf{2y^2 + 3y - 2y - 3}$
6.  **Final Answer:** $\mathbf{2y^2 + y - 3}$

---

#### 2. The Distributive Property (For All Polynomials)

When multiplying a binomial by a trinomial (or any larger polynomial), the **Distributive Property** must be used. FOIL is simply a specialized version of this.

**Procedure:**
Multiply **every term** in the first polynomial by **every term** in the second polynomial.

**Example C: Binomial by Trinomial**

Solve: $\mathbf{(2x - y)(x + 5y - 1)}$

1.  **Distribute $\mathbf{2x}$ to the Trinomial:**
    * $\mathbf{2x \cdot x = 2x^2}$
    * $\mathbf{2x \cdot 5y = +10xy}$
    * $\mathbf{2x \cdot (-1) = -2x}$

2.  **Distribute $\mathbf{-y}$ to the Trinomial:**
    * $\mathbf{-y \cdot x = -xy}$
    * $\mathbf{-y \cdot 5y = -5y^2}$
    * $\mathbf{-y \cdot (-1) = +y}$

3.  **Combine All Terms:**
    $$\mathbf{2x^2 + 10xy - 2x - xy - 5y^2 + y}$$

4.  **Combine Like Terms** ($\mathbf{10xy}$ and $\mathbf{-xy}$):
    $$\mathbf{2x^2 + 9xy - 5y^2 - 2x + y}$$

5.  **Final Answer (Standard Form):**
    $$\mathbf{2x^2 + 9xy - 5y^2 - 2x + y}$$
### Factoring Trinomials and Special Forms 🛠️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=1h31m

Factoring a trinomial ($\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c}$) is the process of reversing polynomial multiplication (FOIL) to rewrite the expression as a product of two binomials.

---

#### 1. Factoring General Trinomials ($\mathbf{a=1}$)

For a trinomial of the form $\mathbf{x^2 + bx + c}$, the goal is to find two numbers ($\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$) that satisfy two conditions:

* **Product Condition:** $\mathbf{p \cdot q = c}$ (They multiply to the constant term)
* **Sum Condition:** $\mathbf{p + q = b}$ (They add up to the middle coefficient)

The factored form is $\mathbf{(x + p)(x + q)}$.

**Example:** Factor $\mathbf{x^2 + 5x + 6}$

1.  Find two numbers that multiply to $\mathbf{6}$ and add to $\mathbf{5}$.
    $$\text{Factors of 6: } (1, 6), (2, 3)$$
2.  The pair $\mathbf{2}$ and $\mathbf{3}$ works ($\mathbf{2 \cdot 3 = 6}$ and $\mathbf{2 + 3 = 5}$).
3.  **Final Factored Form:** $\mathbf{(x + 2)(x + 3)}$

---

#### 2. Factoring by Grouping ($\mathbf{a \neq 1}$)

For trinomials where $\mathbf{a > 1}$ ($\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c}$), use the **a-c Method** (Factoring by Grouping).

**Procedure:**

1.  **Find the Product:** Calculate $\mathbf{a \cdot c}$.
2.  **Find the Pair:** Find two numbers ($\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$) that multiply to $\mathbf{a \cdot c}$ and add to $\mathbf{b}$.
3.  **Rewrite:** Rewrite the middle term ($\mathbf{bx}$) using $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$: $\mathbf{ax^2 + px + qx + c}$.
4.  **Group:** Group the terms into two pairs and factor the $\mathbf{GCF}$ from each pair.
5.  **Final Factor:** Factor out the common binomial factor.

**Example:** Factor $\mathbf{2x^2 + 7x + 3}$

1.  **a $\cdot$ c:** $\mathbf{2 \cdot 3 = 6}$.
2.  **Find Pair:** Numbers that multiply to $\mathbf{6}$ and add to $\mathbf{7}$ are $\mathbf{6}$ and $\mathbf{1}$.
3.  **Rewrite:** $\mathbf{2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3}$
4.  **Group:** $\mathbf{(2x^2 + 6x) + (x + 3)}$
5.  **Factor GCF:** $\mathbf{2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)}$
6.  **Final Answer:** $\mathbf{(2x + 1)(x + 3)}$

---

#### 3. Special Factoring Form: Perfect Square Trinomials (PST)

A **Perfect Square Trinomial** is a trinomial that results from squaring a binomial, making it factorable into two identical binomials.

* **Form 1:** $\mathbf{a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2}$
* **Form 2:** $\mathbf{a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2}$

**Identifying a PST:**
1.  The first term ($\mathbf{a^2}$) and the last term ($\mathbf{b^2}$) are both **perfect squares**.
2.  The middle term ($\mathbf{2ab}$) is **twice the product** of the square roots of the first and last terms.

**Example:** Factor $\mathbf{9x^2 - 30x + 25}$
1.  $\mathbf{\sqrt{9x^2} = 3x}$ ($\mathbf{a=3x}$) and $\mathbf{\sqrt{25} = 5}$ ($\mathbf{b=5}$).
2.  Check Middle Term: $\mathbf{2ab = 2(3x)(5) = 30x}$. (Matches!)
3.  **Final Factored Form:** $\mathbf{(3x - 5)^2}$

---

#### 4. Factoring Exponents and GCF

Always look for a **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** first, especially with variables. When factoring a GCF, use the **smallest exponent** present in all terms.

**Factoring Exponent Rule:** $\mathbf{x^a + x^b = x^{\min(a,b)} \cdot (x^{a - \min(a,b)} + x^{b - \min(a,b)})}$

**Example:** Factor $\mathbf{4x^5 - 8x^3 + 12x^2}$

1.  **GCF (Coefficients):** $\mathbf{4}$
2.  **GCF (Variables):** Smallest exponent of $\mathbf{x}$ is $\mathbf{x^2}$.
3.  **Overall GCF:** $\mathbf{4x^2}$
4.  **Factor Out GCF:** $\mathbf{4x^2(\hphantom{x})}$
5.  **Use Subtraction Rule to find remaining exponents:**
    * $\mathbf{4x^5 / 4x^2 = 1x^{5-2} = x^3}$
    * $\mathbf{-8x^3 / 4x^2 = -2x^{3-2} = -2x^1}$
    * $\mathbf{+12x^2 / 4x^2 = +3x^{2-2} = 3x^0 = 3}$
6.  **Final Answer:** $\mathbf{4x^2(x^3 - 2x + 3)}$

---

#### 5. Note on Perfect Cubes

The term **Perfect Cube** is related to the **Sum or Difference of Cubes** factoring patterns, which are different from trinomial factoring.

* **Sum of Cubes:** $\mathbf{a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}$
* **Difference of Cubes:** $\mathbf{a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)}$
### Synthetic Division ➗
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=1h39m45s
**Synthetic Division** is a quick, shorthand method for dividing a **polynomial** by a **linear binomial** of the form $\mathbf{(x - k)}$. It is much faster and simpler than long division.

---

#### 1. When to Use Synthetic Division

* **Divisor Must Be Linear:** The divisor must be in the form $\mathbf{(x - k)}$ or $\mathbf{(x + k)}$.
    * **Example (OK):** $\mathbf{(x - 3)}$, $\mathbf{(x + 5)}$, $\mathbf{(x - 1/2)}$
    * **Example (NOT OK):** $\mathbf{(x^2 + 1)}$, $\mathbf{(2x - 1)}$ (You must factor out the 2 first).

---

#### 2. The Setup

To divide a polynomial $P(x)$ by $\mathbf{(x - k)}$:

1.  **Identify $k$:** Set the divisor equal to zero to find $\mathbf{k}$.
    * If the divisor is $\mathbf{(x - 3)}$, then $\mathbf{k = 3}$.
    * If the divisor is $\mathbf{(x + 5)}$, then $\mathbf{k = -5}$.
2.  **Standard Form:** Ensure the polynomial $P(x)$ is written in **standard form** (highest exponent first).
3.  **Placeholders:** If any term is missing (e.g., no $\mathbf{x^2}$ term), you **must** use a $\mathbf{0}$ as a placeholder for its coefficient.
4.  **Write Coefficients:** Write the coefficients of the polynomial in a row.

$$\text{Setup: } \mathbf{k} \text{ | } \mathbf{a} \quad \mathbf{b} \quad \mathbf{c} \quad \mathbf{d} \dots$$

---

#### 3. The Procedure

Follow these steps for every coefficient:

1.  **Drop:** Bring the **first coefficient** ($\mathbf{a}$) straight down below the line.
2.  **Multiply:** Multiply the number you just wrote ($\mathbf{a}$) by $\mathbf{k}$. Write the result under the next coefficient ($\mathbf{b}$).
3.  **Add:** Add the numbers in the second column ($\mathbf{b}$ and the product). Write the result below the line.
4.  **Repeat:** Continue the multiply-and-add cycle until you reach the end.

---

#### 4. Interpreting the Result

The numbers below the line represent the coefficients of the **quotient polynomial** and the **remainder**.

$$\text{Result: } \mathbf{a} \quad \mathbf{\text{coeff}_2} \quad \mathbf{\text{coeff}_1} \quad \mathbf{\text{Remainder}}$$

1.  The **last number** is the **Remainder ($\mathbf{R}$)**.
2.  The remaining numbers are the coefficients of the quotient, starting with an exponent **one less** than the original polynomial's highest exponent.

$$\mathbf{\text{Quotient} = (\text{coeff}_2)x^2 + (\text{coeff}_1)x + \text{Constant} + \frac{R}{\text{Divisor}}}$$

---

#### 5. Example: $\mathbf{(x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 12) \div (x + 4)}$

1.  **Identify $k$:** Divisor is $\mathbf{(x + 4)}$, so $\mathbf{k = -4}$.
2.  **Coefficients:** $\mathbf{1, 2, -5, 12}$. (No missing terms).

$$\mathbf{-4} \text{ | } \mathbf{1} \quad \mathbf{2} \quad \mathbf{-5} \quad \mathbf{12}$$
$$\mathbf{\hphantom{-4}} \text{ | } \mathbf{\hphantom{1}} \quad \mathbf{-4} \quad \mathbf{8} \quad \mathbf{-12}$$
$$\mathbf{\hphantom{-4}} \text{ | } \mathbf{\hphantom{1}} \quad \mathbf{\hphantom{2}} \quad \mathbf{\hphantom{-5}} \quad \mathbf{\hphantom{12}}$$
$$\mathbf{\hphantom{-4}} \text{ | } \mathbf{1} \quad \mathbf{-2} \quad \mathbf{3} \quad \mathbf{0}$$

* **Remainder:** $\mathbf{0}$
* **Quotient Coefficients:** $\mathbf{1, -2, 3}$
* **Quotient Polynomial:** Since the original polynomial was degree 3, the quotient starts at degree 2.

**Final Answer:** $$\mathbf{x^2 - 2x + 3}$$
### X. Theorems for Polynomial Roots 🧪

These theorems relate the remainder of polynomial division to the roots (zeros) of the polynomial, $\mathbf{P(x)}$.

---

#### 1. The Remainder Theorem

The Remainder Theorem provides a shortcut for evaluating a polynomial at a specific value $\mathbf{k}$.

**Concept:** The remainder ($\mathbf{R}$) obtained when dividing a polynomial ($\mathbf{P(x)}$) by a linear divisor ($\mathbf{x - k}$) is exactly equal to the value of the polynomial when evaluated at $\mathbf{x = k}$.

**Formula:**
$$\mathbf{R = P(k)}$$

| Term | Meaning in Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{P(x)}$** | The **Dividend Polynomial** being evaluated. |
| **$\mathbf{x - k}$** | The **Divisor**; $\mathbf{k}$ is the value used in synthetic division. |
| **$\mathbf{R}$** | The **Remainder** from synthetic division. |
| **$\mathbf{P(k)}$** | The **output** of the polynomial when $\mathbf{x = k}$. |

**Application:** To find $\mathbf{P(5)}$, you can either substitute $x=5$ into $P(x)$ OR use synthetic division with $\mathbf{k=5}$; the result will be $\mathbf{R}$.

---

#### 2. The Factor Theorem

The Factor Theorem is a direct extension of the Remainder Theorem, establishing when a binomial is a factor of a polynomial.

**Concept:** A linear binomial $\mathbf{(x - k)}$ is a factor of the polynomial $\mathbf{P(x)}$ if and only if the remainder of the division is zero.

**Formula:**
$$\mathbf{(x - k) \text{ is a factor of } P(x) \iff P(k) = 0}$$

| Condition | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- |
| **If $\mathbf{P(k) = 0}$** | $\mathbf{(x - k)}$ **IS** a factor of $P(x)$, and $\mathbf{k}$ is a root/zero. |
| **If $\mathbf{P(k) \neq 0}$** | $\mathbf{(x - k)}$ is **NOT** a factor of $P(x)$. |

**Application:** To check if $\mathbf{(x + 2)}$ is a factor of $P(x)$, use synthetic division with $\mathbf{k = -2}$. If the remainder is $0$, it is a factor.
### Quadratic Formula :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=1h46m45s

The **Quadratic Formula** is an algebraic tool used to find the solutions (roots, zeros, or x-intercepts) of any **quadratic equation** in standard form.

---

#### 1. The Standard Form and The Formula

The formula works for any quadratic equation written in the **Standard Form**:
$$\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$$

The **Quadratic Formula** is:
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$$

* **Variables:** $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$ are the coefficients from the standard form equation.
* **Result:** The formula provides **two** potential solutions due to the $\mathbf{\pm}$ sign: $\mathbf{x_1}$ (using the $+$) and $\mathbf{x_2}$ (using the $-$).

---

#### 2. The Discriminant ($\mathbf{D}$)

The expression **under the square root** is called the **Discriminant** ($\mathbf{D}$). It determines the number and type of solutions the equation has.

$$\mathbf{D = b^2 - 4ac}$$

| Value of D | Number and Type of Solutions (Roots) |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{D > 0}$ (Positive) | **Two** distinct real solutions. |
| $\mathbf{D = 0}$ | **One** real solution (a double root). |
| $\mathbf{D < 0}$ (Negative) | **Zero** real solutions (Two complex/imaginary solutions). |

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Use

**Example:** Solve $\mathbf{3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0}$ using the formula.

**Step 1: Identify $\mathbf{a, b, c}$**
* Ensure the equation is set to zero ($\mathbf{= 0}$).
* Identify the coefficients: $\mathbf{a=3}$, $\mathbf{b=-5}$, $\mathbf{c=2}$.

**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant (Optional, but recommended)**
* Substitute values into $\mathbf{D = b^2 - 4ac}$:
    $$\mathbf{D = (-5)^2 - 4(3)(2)}$$
    $$\mathbf{D = 25 - 24}$$
    $$\mathbf{D = 1}$$
* **Analysis:** Since $\mathbf{D > 0}$, there are two real solutions.

**Step 3: Substitute Values into the Formula**
* Substitute $\mathbf{a, b, c}$ into the full formula:
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(3)(2)}}{2(3)}}$$

**Step 4: Simplify**
* Simplify the numerator and denominator:
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{6}}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{6}}$$

**Step 5: Separate and Find the Solutions**
* **Solution 1 (Using +):**
    $$\mathbf{x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1}$$
* **Solution 2 (Using -):**
    $$\mathbf{x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}}$$

**Final Answer:** The solutions are $\mathbf{x = 1}$ and $\mathbf{x = 2/3}$.
### Rational Expressions (Fractions with Polynomials) 🧩:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=1h48m50s

A **Rational Expression** is a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are **polynomials**. It is essentially the ratio of two polynomials.

$$\text{Example: } \mathbf{\frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 2}} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{\frac{3a + 9}{a^2 - 1}}$$

---

#### 1. The Fundamental Rule: Excluded Values

The most important rule for rational expressions is that the **denominator can never equal zero**. This defines the **Excluded Values** (or domain restrictions).

**Procedure to find Excluded Values:**

1.  Set the **denominator** equal to zero.
2.  Solve the resulting equation for the variable(s).
3.  These values are the domain restrictions—the numbers the variable **cannot** equal.

**Example:** Find the excluded value for $\mathbf{\frac{5x}{x - 3}}$

1.  Set denominator to zero: $\mathbf{x - 3 = 0}$
2.  Solve: $\mathbf{x = 3}$
3.  **Excluded Value:** $\mathbf{x \neq 3}$

---

#### 2. Simplifying Rational Expressions

Simplifying (or reducing) rational expressions requires factoring both the numerator and the denominator and then canceling common factors.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Factor:** Completely factor the numerator and the denominator. Use all factoring techniques (GCF, trinomial factoring, Difference of Squares).
2.  **Cancel:** Identify and cancel any identical factors that appear in **both** the numerator and the denominator.

**Example:** Simplify $\mathbf{\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x + 2}}$

1.  **Factor:**
    * Numerator: $\mathbf{x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)}$
    * Denominator: $\mathbf{(x + 2)}$
    $$\mathbf{\frac{(x + 2)(x + 3)}{(x + 2)}}$$
2.  **Cancel:** Cancel the common factor $\mathbf{(x + 2)}$.
3.  **Simplified Form:** $\mathbf{x + 3}$
    *(Note: The excluded value here is still $x \neq -2$, even though the simplified form doesn't show it.)*

---

#### 3. Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions

**A. Multiplication**

* **Rule:** Multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. $\mathbf{\frac{A}{B} \cdot \frac{C}{D} = \frac{AC}{BD}}$
* **Best Practice:** Factor all parts first, cancel common factors **diagonally** and **vertically**, and then multiply the remaining terms.

**B. Division**

* **Rule:** Change the operation to multiplication and use the **reciprocal** (flip) of the second fraction (**"Keep, Change, Flip"**).
* $\mathbf{\frac{A}{B} \div \frac{C}{D} = \frac{A}{B} \cdot \frac{D}{C}}$
* Then, follow the steps for multiplication (factor, cancel, multiply).

---

#### 4. Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

To add or subtract, you must have a **Least Common Denominator (LCD)**.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Find LCD:** Factor all denominators and find the LCD by taking every unique factor, raised to its highest power.
2.  **Adjust Numerators:** Multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the factor(s) needed to create the LCD.
3.  **Combine:** Add or subtract the numerators (distributing the subtraction sign if necessary).
4.  **Simplify:** Simplify the resulting fraction by factoring and canceling any final common terms.
## Functions :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=2h45s
### Functions and Relations ⚙️

A **Function** is a special type of **Relation** where every input ($\mathbf{x}$) has exactly one output ($\mathbf{y}$).

---

#### 1. Relations vs. Functions

| Term | Definition | Key Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relation** | Any set of ordered pairs ($\mathbf{(x, y)}$). | No restrictions. |
| **Function** | A relation where no two ordered pairs have the same **x-value** and different **y-values**. | Each **input** ($\mathbf{x}$) has exactly **one output** ($\mathbf{y}$). |

**Testing for a Function**

* **Mapping Diagram:** No input arrow should split to two different outputs.
* **Vertical Line Test (VLT):** If a vertical line drawn anywhere on the graph intersects the graph at **more than one point**, the graph is **NOT** a function.

---

#### 2. Function Notation and Evaluation

**A. Function Notation**

* Instead of $\mathbf{y = \dots}$, we write $\mathbf{f(x) = \dots}$ (read as **"f of x"**).
* $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is simply a substitute for the dependent variable $\mathbf{y}$.

$$\mathbf{y = 3x - 1} \quad \text{is the same as} \quad \mathbf{f(x) = 3x - 1}$$

**B. Evaluating Functions**

Evaluating a function means finding the output ($\mathbf{y}$ or $\mathbf{f(x)}$) for a specific input ($\mathbf{x}$).

**Example:** Given $\mathbf{f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3}$, find $\mathbf{f(4)}$.

1.  **Substitute:** Replace every $\mathbf{x}$ in the function with the input value ($\mathbf{4}$).
    $$\mathbf{f(4) = (4)^2 + 2(4) - 3}$$
2.  **Simplify:**
    $$\mathbf{f(4) = 16 + 8 - 3}$$
3.  **Result:**
    $$\mathbf{f(4) = 21}$$

---

#### 3. Domain and Range

These terms describe the set of possible input and output values for a function.

| Term | Definition | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain** | The set of all possible **input** values ($\mathbf{x}$). | What **x-values** the graph covers (left to right). |
| **Range** | The set of all possible **output** values ($\mathbf{y}$). | What **y-values** the graph covers (bottom to top). |

**Identifying Restrictions (Domain):**

The domain of polynomials is generally **all real numbers**, but restrictions commonly occur in two cases:

1.  **Fractions (Rational Functions):** The denominator **cannot be zero**.
    $$\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 5} \implies x \neq 5}$$
2.  **Square Roots (Radical Functions):** The value inside the square root **must be non-negative** ($\mathbf{\ge 0}$).
    $$\mathbf{f(x) = \sqrt{x + 2} \implies x + 2 \ge 0 \implies x \ge -2}$$
### Inverse Functions ↩️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=2h9m05s

An **Inverse Function** (denoted $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$) is a function that "undoes" the action of the original function $\mathbf{f(x)}$. When composed, an inverse function takes the output ($\mathbf{y}$) of the original function and returns the original input ($\mathbf{x}$).

---

#### 1. Definition and Notation

* **Notation:** The inverse of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is written as $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$ (read as "f-inverse of x").
    * **Caution:** The $\mathbf{-1}$ is NOT an exponent; $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) \neq \frac{1}{f(x)}}$.
* **Key Property:** If $\mathbf{f(a) = b}$, then the inverse must satisfy $\mathbf{f^{-1}(b) = a}$.
* **Composition Rule:** When a function and its inverse are composed, they result in the input:
    $$\mathbf{f(f^{-1}(x)) = x} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{f^{-1}(f(x)) = x}$$

---

#### 2. Relationship between Domain and Range

The domain and range of a function and its inverse are simply swapped.

| Function | Input/Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Original Function ($\mathbf{f(x)}$)** | Domain is the $\mathbf{x}$-values; Range is the $\mathbf{y}$-values. |
| **Inverse Function ($\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$)** | Domain is the original Range; Range is the original Domain. |

---

#### 3. Step-by-Step Procedure for Finding the Inverse

Use these four algebraic steps to find the inverse of a function, $\mathbf{f(x)}$.

**Example:** Find the inverse of $\mathbf{f(x) = 2x + 3}$.

| Step | Operation | Example (f(x) = 2x + 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Replace $\mathbf{f(x)}$ with $\mathbf{y}$** | Simplifies the notation. | $$\mathbf{y = 2x + 3}$$ |
| **2. Swap $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$** | This reverses the input and output roles of the function. | $$\mathbf{x = 2y + 3}$$ |
| **3. Solve for $\mathbf{y}$** | Isolate the new $\mathbf{y}$ variable. | $$\mathbf{x - 3 = 2y \implies y = \frac{x - 3}{2}}$$ |
| **4. Replace $\mathbf{y}$ with $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$** | Rewrite the equation using inverse function notation. | $$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}}$$ |

---

#### 4. Graphical Relationship

The graph of a function and its inverse are **reflections** of each other across the line $\mathbf{y = x}$.

* If the point $\mathbf{(a, b)}$ is on the graph of $\mathbf{f(x)}$, then the point $\mathbf{(b, a)}$ must be on the graph of $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$.
### Graphing Functions 📈
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=2h10m12s

Graphing involves plotting the set of ordered pairs ($\mathbf{x, y}$) that make a function true. The shape of the graph is determined by the function's type (linear, quadratic, absolute value, etc.).

---

### 1. Key Graph Components

| Component | Definition | How to Find on Graph |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain** | All possible **input** ($\mathbf{x}$) values. | Read the graph from **left to right** ($\mathbf{-\infty}$ to $\mathbf{+\infty}$). |
| **Range** | All possible **output** ($\mathbf{y}$) values. | Read the graph from **bottom to top** ($\mathbf{-\infty}$ to $\mathbf{+\infty}$). |
| **x-intercept** | The point(s) where the graph crosses the $\mathbf{x}$-axis ($\mathbf{y=0}$). | The solutions/roots/zeros of the equation $\mathbf{f(x) = 0}$. |
| **y-intercept** | The point where the graph crosses the $\mathbf{y}$-axis ($\mathbf{x=0}$). | The value $\mathbf{f(0)}$. |
| **Vertex** | The minimum or maximum point of a parabola or absolute value graph. | The turning point of the graph. |

---

### 2. Common Function Types and Shapes

| Function Type      | General Form                 | Shape Example                                                 |       |                |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | -------------- |
| **Linear**         | $\mathbf{y = mx + b}$        | A **straight line**.                                          |       |                |
| **Quadratic**      | $\mathbf{y = ax^2 + bx + c}$ | A **parabola** ($\mathbf{U}$-shape or $\mathbf{\cap}$-shape). |       |                |
| **Absolute Value** | $\mathbf{y = a               | x - h                                                         | + k}$ | A **V-shape**. |
| **Cubic**          | $\mathbf{y = ax^3 + \dots}$  | An **S-curve**.                                               |       |                |

---

### 3. Function Transformations

Function transformations allow you to graph complex functions by understanding how they shift, stretch, or reflect a simple **Parent Function** (e.g., $\mathbf{f(x) = x^2}$ or $\mathbf{f(x) = |x|}$).

The general transformed form is: $$\mathbf{y = a \cdot f(x - h) + k}$$

| Transformation | Variable | Effect on the Graph |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vertical Shift** | $\mathbf{+k}$ (outside $f(x)$) | Moves the graph $\mathbf{k}$ units **UP** ($\mathbf{+k}$) or **DOWN** ($\mathbf{-k}$). |
| **Horizontal Shift** | $\mathbf{-h}$ (inside $f(x)$) | Moves the graph $\mathbf{h}$ units **RIGHT** ($\mathbf{-h}$) or **LEFT** ($\mathbf{+h}$). *(It's the opposite of the sign!)* |
| **Vertical Stretch/Compress** | $\mathbf{a}$ (coefficient) | **Stretch** if $\mathbf{|a| > 1}$ (narrower); **Compress** if $\mathbf{0 < |a| < 1}$ (wider). |
| **Reflection** | $\mathbf{-a}$ (negative sign on $\mathbf{a}$) | Reflects the graph across the **x-axis** (flips it upside down). |

**Example:** Graph $\mathbf{f(x) = -2|x - 3| + 1}$

* **Parent Function:** $\mathbf{|x|}$ (V-shape, vertex at $\mathbf{(0, 0)}$)
* **$\mathbf{h = 3}$:** Shift **Right 3** units.
* **$\mathbf{k = 1}$:** Shift **Up 1** unit. (New vertex at $\mathbf{(3, 1)}$)
* **$\mathbf{a = -2}$:** Vertical **Stretch** (by a factor of 2) and **Reflection** across the x-axis (opens downward).
### Asymptotes (Boundaries of a Graph) 🛑
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=2h21m10s

An **Asymptote** is a line that a function's graph approaches but never touches or crosses as the input ($\mathbf{x}$) or output ($\mathbf{y}$) values tend toward infinity or negative infinity.

Asymptotes define the boundaries or restricted areas of a graph, most commonly found in **Rational Functions** ($\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}}$).

---

### 1. Vertical Asymptotes (VA)

**Vertical Asymptotes** are vertical lines ($\mathbf{x = \text{a number}}$) that the graph cannot cross. They are directly related to the **Excluded Values** of the function's domain.

* **Source:** They occur at the $\mathbf{x}$-values that make the **denominator zero** and **do not** cancel out with a factor in the numerator.

**Rule:**
Set the denominator $\mathbf{Q(x)}$ equal to zero and solve for $\mathbf{x}$, *after* simplifying the rational expression.

**Example:** Find the VA of $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x - 4}}$

1.  Denominator: $\mathbf{x - 4}$
2.  Set to zero: $\mathbf{x - 4 = 0}$
3.  **Vertical Asymptote:** $\mathbf{x = 4}$ (The graph approaches $x=4$ but never touches it).

---

### 2. Horizontal Asymptotes (HA)

**Horizontal Asymptotes** are horizontal lines ($\mathbf{y = \text{a number}}$) that the graph approaches as $\mathbf{x}$ goes to $\mathbf{\pm \infty}$. They are determined by comparing the **degree** (highest exponent) of the numerator ($\mathbf{N}$) and the denominator ($\mathbf{D}$).

Let $\mathbf{n}$ be the degree of the numerator and $\mathbf{m}$ be the degree of the denominator.

| Case (Degree Comparison) | Rule | Horizontal Asymptote ($\mathbf{y = \dots}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Case 1: $\mathbf{n < m}$** (Bottom Heavy) | The denominator grows faster than the numerator. | $\mathbf{y = 0}$ (The x-axis) |
| **Case 2: $\mathbf{n = m}$** (Equal Degrees) | The function approaches the ratio of the leading coefficients. | $\mathbf{y = \frac{\text{Leading Coefficient of N}}{\text{Leading Coefficient of D}}}$ |
| **Case 3: $\mathbf{n > m}$** (Top Heavy) | The numerator grows much faster than the denominator. | **No Horizontal Asymptote** (The function has a slant/oblique asymptote instead). |

**Example 1 (Bottom Heavy):** $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^3 + 1}}$
* $\mathbf{n=2}$, $\mathbf{m=3}$. Since $\mathbf{2 < 3}$, the HA is $\mathbf{y = 0}$.

**Example 2 (Equal Degrees):** $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{3x^2 - x + 1}{x^2 + 5}}$
* $\mathbf{n=2}$, $\mathbf{m=2}$. The leading coefficients are $3$ and $1$. The HA is $\mathbf{y = \frac{3}{1} = 3}$.

---

### 3. Holes (Removable Discontinuities)

A **Hole** is a single point where the graph is undefined. It is a "missing point" in the graph, not a line boundary.

* **Source:** A hole occurs at an $\mathbf{x}$-value that makes the **denominator zero** but **does** cancel out with an identical factor in the numerator.

**Rule:**
1.  Factor the numerator and denominator.
2.  Cancel the common factor $\mathbf{(x - a)}$.
3.  A hole exists at $\mathbf{x = a}$.
4.  To find the $\mathbf{y}$-coordinate of the hole, substitute $\mathbf{x = a}$ into the simplified (cancelled) expression.

**Example:** Find the hole of $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}}$

1.  Factor: $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{(x - 2)}}$
2.  Cancel $\mathbf{(x - 2)}$. A hole exists at $\mathbf{x = 2}$.
3.  Simplified function: $\mathbf{g(x) = x + 2}$
4.  Find y-coordinate: $\mathbf{g(2) = 2 + 2 = 4}$.
5.  **Hole Location:** $\mathbf{(2, 4)}$

## Logarithmic Expressions (Logs) 🧮 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgfIOWVnF4&t=2h23m21s

A **Logarithm** is simply the **exponent** to which a specific base must be raised to obtain a certain number. Logarithms are the inverse of exponential functions.

---

### 1. The Logarithmic Definition

The key to understanding logs is converting between exponential form and logarithmic form.

| Form | Equation | Read As | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exponential** | $$\mathbf{b^x = y}$$ | "$b$ to the power of $x$ equals $y$" | The base $b$ raised to the exponent $x$ gives $y$. |
| **Logarithmic** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(y) = x}$$ | "Log base $b$ of $y$ equals $x$" | The exponent $x$ needed on base $b$ to get $y$. |

**Key Constraints:**
* The **Base $\mathbf{b}$** must be positive ($\mathbf{b > 0}$) and $\mathbf{b \neq 1}$.
* The **Argument $\mathbf{y}$** must be positive ($\mathbf{y > 0}$).

**Example Conversion:**

* $$\mathbf{3^4 = 81} \implies \mathbf{\log_3(81) = 4}$$
* $$\mathbf{\log_{10}(1000) = 3} \implies \mathbf{10^3 = 1000}$$

---

### 2. Common Logarithms

Certain bases have special notation used frequently in math and science:

| Logarithm Type | Notation | Implied Base | Exponential Form |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Log** | $$\mathbf{\log(x)}$$ | $$\mathbf{b = 10}$$ | $$\mathbf{10^y = x}$$ |
| **Natural Log** | $$\mathbf{\ln(x)}$$ | $$\mathbf{b = e \approx 2.718}$$ | $$\mathbf{e^y = x}$$ |

---

### 3. Logarithm Properties (The Rules of Exponents for Logs)

Since logs are exponents, they follow similar rules for multiplication, division, and powers.

| Rule Name | Logarithmic Property | Corresponding Exponent Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Rule** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)}$$ | $$\mathbf{b^{m+n} = b^m \cdot b^n}$$ |
| **Quotient Rule** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(\frac{x}{y}) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)}$$ | $$\mathbf{b^{m-n} = \frac{b^m}{b^n}}$$ |
| **Power Rule** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(x^p) = p \cdot \log_b(x)}$$ | $$\mathbf{(b^m)^p = b^{m \cdot p}}$$ |

**Special Properties:**

| Property | Rule | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log of the Base** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(b) = 1}$$ | Because $\mathbf{b^1 = b}$. |
| **Log of One** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(1) = 0}$$ | Because $\mathbf{b^0 = 1}$. |
| **Inverse Property 1** | $$\mathbf{\log_b(b^x) = x}$$ | The $\log$ and the base cancel out. |
| **Inverse Property 2** | $$\mathbf{b^{\log_b(x)} = x}$$ | The base and the $\log$ cancel out. |

---

### 4. Change of Base Formula

Used to evaluate a logarithm with any base $b$ using a calculator (which typically only has $\log_{10}$ or $\ln$).

$$\mathbf{\log_b(y) = \frac{\log_a(y)}{\log_a(b)} \quad \text{or commonly:} \quad \frac{\log(y)}{\log(b)} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(b)}}$$

### Types of Logarithms and Euler's Number 🌐

A **Logarithm** is the exponent a base must be raised to in order to get a number ($\mathbf{\log_b(y) = x} \iff \mathbf{b^x = y}$). The type of logarithm is determined by the base ($\mathbf{b}$).

---

### 1. Common Logarithm (Base 10)

The **Common Logarithm** is the log function used when no base is explicitly written. It's the base of our decimal system.

* **Base:** $\mathbf{b = 10}$
* **Notation:** $$\mathbf{\log(x)}$$
* **Definition:** $$\mathbf{\log(x) = y} \iff \mathbf{10^y = x}$$
* **Calculator:** This is the standard "log" button on most calculators.

**Example:**
* $$\mathbf{\log(100) = 2} \quad \text{because} \quad \mathbf{10^2 = 100}$$

---

### 2. Natural Logarithm (Base $e$)

The **Natural Logarithm** is one of the most important logarithms in mathematics and finance, as it is the inverse of the natural exponential function $\mathbf{e^x}$.

* **Base:** $\mathbf{b = e}$ (Euler's Number)
* **Notation:** $$\mathbf{\ln(x)}$$
* **Definition:** $$\mathbf{\ln(x) = y} \iff \mathbf{e^y = x}$$
* **Calculator:** This is the standard "ln" button on most calculators.

#### Defining Euler's Number ($\mathbf{e}$)
* **Value:** $\mathbf{e}$ is an irrational number, approximately $\mathbf{e \approx 2.71828}$.
* **Concept:** It represents the limit of continuous growth, often defined as:
    $$\mathbf{e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n}$$
You can use it to calculate the interest (if you had 200% returns, then $e^2$ = 2.7182 * 2.7182 = 7.389% interest returned)
### Applications of Euler's Number ($\mathbf{e}$) 🧑‍💻

**Euler's Number ($\mathbf{e \approx 2.718}$)** is the base of the **Natural Logarithm ($\mathbf{\ln}$)** and the base for continuous growth in mathematics, finance, and science.

---

#### 1. Evaluating Natural Logarithms ($\mathbf{\ln}$)

The core use of $e$ in Algebra is understanding its inverse relationship with the Natural Log, $\mathbf{\ln}$.

**Formula:**
$$\mathbf{\ln(y) = x} \iff \mathbf{e^x = y}$$

**Example 1: Solving $\mathbf{\ln(e^5)}$**

This uses the **Inverse Property $\mathbf{\ln(e^x) = x}$**.

| Step | Operation | Expression | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Apply Inverse Property** | The natural log ($\mathbf{\ln}$) and its base ($\mathbf{e}$) cancel each other out. | $$\mathbf{\ln(e^5) = 5}$$ | The exponent **$5$** is the answer. |
| **2. Final Result** | | $$\mathbf{5}$$ | |

**Example 2: Solving $\mathbf{\ln(\frac{1}{e^2}) = x}$**

This requires using exponent rules before applying the inverse property.

| Step | Operation | Expression | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Use Negative Exponent Rule** | Move $e^2$ to the numerator by changing the sign of the exponent. | $$\mathbf{\ln(e^{-2})}$$ | $$\mathbf{\frac{1}{e^2} = e^{-2}}$$ |
| **2. Apply Inverse Property** | The $\mathbf{\ln}$ and $\mathbf{e}$ cancel. | $$\mathbf{-2}$$ | The remaining exponent is the solution. |
| **3. Final Result** | | $$\mathbf{-2}$$ | |

---

#### 2. Simplifying Exponential Expressions with Base $e$

This demonstrates the other Inverse Property: $\mathbf{e^{\ln(x)} = x}$.

**Example 3: Solving $\mathbf{e^{2 \cdot \ln(3)}}$**

This requires the **Power Rule for Logs** to simplify the exponent first.

| Step | Operation | Expression | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Apply Log Power Rule** | Move the coefficient $\mathbf{2}$ back up into the log argument as an exponent. | $$\mathbf{e^{\ln(3^2)}}$$ | $\mathbf{p \cdot \ln(x) = \ln(x^p)}$ |
| **2. Simplify the Exponent** | Calculate $3^2$. | $$\mathbf{e^{\ln(9)}}$$ | |
| **3. Apply Inverse Property** | The base $\mathbf{e}$ and the exponent $\mathbf{\ln}$ cancel each other out. | $$\mathbf{9}$$ | The remaining argument is the solution. |
| **4. Final Result** | | $$\mathbf{9}$$ | |

---

#### 3. Continuous Compounding Formula

$e$ is used in models for continuous growth, such as compound interest.

**Formula (Continuous Compounding):**
$$\mathbf{A = Pe^{rt}}$$

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A}$** | Final amount (value after $t$ years). |
| **$\mathbf{P}$** | Principal amount (initial investment). |
| **$\mathbf{r}$** | Annual interest rate (as a decimal). |
| **$\mathbf{t}$** | Time in years. |
| **$\mathbf{e}$** | Euler's Number (constant $\approx 2.718$). |

**Example 4: Calculating Compounding**

* **Problem:** Find the final amount if $\mathbf{\$1000}$ is invested at $\mathbf{5\%}$ interest compounded continuously for $\mathbf{10}$ years.
* **Given:** $\mathbf{P=1000}$, $\mathbf{r=0.05}$, $\mathbf{t=10}$.

| Step | Operation | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Substitute Values** | Sub in $\mathbf{P, r, t}$. | $$\mathbf{A = 1000 \cdot e^{(0.05 \cdot 10)}}$$ | |
| **2. Simplify Exponent** | $\mathbf{0.05 \cdot 10 = 0.5}$. | $$\mathbf{A = 1000 \cdot e^{0.5}}$$ | |
| **3. Calculate $\mathbf{e}$ Term** | Use a calculator for $\mathbf{e^{0.5} \approx 1.6487}$. | $$\mathbf{A \approx 1000 \cdot 1.6487}$$ | |
| **4. Final Result** | Multiply by $\mathbf{1000}$. | $$\mathbf{A \approx 1648.72}$$ | Final amount is $\mathbf{\$1648.72}$. |
---

### 3. General Logarithm and the Power Rule

The general form is $\mathbf{\log_b(y)}$, where $b$ can be any valid positive base (not equal to 1). A key property applies when the argument of the log is a number raised to a power.

* **Formula:** $$\mathbf{\log_b(a^p) = p \cdot \log_b(a)}$$
* **Rule:** The exponent ($\mathbf{p}$) of the argument ($\mathbf{a}$) can be moved to the front of the logarithm as a **coefficient**. This is called the **Power Rule** for Logarithms.

**Examples:**
1.  $$\mathbf{\log_2(8^3)} = \mathbf{3 \cdot \log_2(8)}$$
    * Since $\mathbf{\log_2(8) = 3}$, the total result is $\mathbf{3 \cdot 3 = 9}$.
2.  $$\mathbf{\ln(x^4)} = \mathbf{4 \cdot \ln(x)}$$
## XI. Exponents, Radicals, and Logarithms

### 1. Rational Exponents and Radicals

These formulas define the relationship between fractional exponents and roots (radicals).

* **Fractional Exponent to Radical Form:** The denominator ($\mathbf{b}$) of the fraction becomes the root index, and the numerator ($\mathbf{a}$) becomes the exponent inside or outside the radical.
    $$\mathbf{x^{a/b} = \sqrt[b]{x}^a} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{x^{a/b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}}$$

    * *Note: These two forms are equivalent.*

* **Radical to Fractional Exponent Form:** The root index ($\mathbf{n}$) becomes the denominator of the exponent.
    $$\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{1/n}}$$

---

### 2. Logarithm Properties and Forms

These rules demonstrate conversions between forms and how to expand or condense logarithmic expressions, specifically using the **Natural Log ($\mathbf{\ln}$)**.

* **General Logarithmic Form:** This is the base notation for all logarithms, where $\mathbf{a}$ is the base and $\mathbf{b}$ is the argument.
    $$\mathbf{\log_a{b}}$$

* **Logarithm Product/Sum Rule (Expansion):** The log of a product is the sum of the logs.
    $$\mathbf{\ln(x^2) + \ln(3) + \ln(y) = \ln(3x^2y)}$$
    * *Note: This reverses the expansion process. The Power Rule ($\mathbf{\ln(x^2) = 2\ln(x)}$) is used for the first term during expansion.*

* **Logarithm Quotient Rule (Condensation):** Subtraction of logs (like $\mathbf{\ln(x^2) - \ln(3)}$) means the arguments were divided.
    $$\mathbf{\ln(x^2) - \ln(3) = \ln(\frac{x^2}{3})}$$

* **Logarithm Expression (Condensation Example):** A full example combining the sum and difference rules.
    $$\mathbf{\ln(x^2) - \ln(3) + \ln(y) = \ln\left(\frac{x^2y}{3}\right)}$$

* **Inverse Property/Power Rule Example:** This uses the relationship between $\mathbf{\ln}$ (log base $\mathbf{e}$) and $\mathbf{e}$.
    $$\mathbf{\ln(10^3) = 3 \cdot \ln(10)}$$
    * *Note: The number 3 has been moved from the exponent to the coefficient using the **Power Rule**.*
