##### 🎯 Linear Equations: Determining the Number of Solutions

To determine the number of solutions for a linear equation in the form $\text{ax} + \text{b} = \text{cx} + \text{d}$, always **fully simplify** the equation first. The result of the simplification determines the solution set.

---

##### 1. Infinitely Many Solutions (All Real Numbers) ♾️

This means **any** real number will satisfy the original equation.

* **Condition:** The coefficients and the constants on both sides are **identical** after simplifying.
    * $\text{a} = \text{c}$ **AND** $\text{b} = \text{d}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable terms cancel out, leaving a **TRUE statement** (a mathematical identity).
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{0 = 0}$$
    $$\text{10z + 1 = 10z + 1}$$

---

##### 2. No Solutions 🚫

This means **no** real number can satisfy the original equation.

* **Condition:** The variable coefficients are the **same**, but the constants are **different**.
    * $\text{a} = \text{c}$ **BUT** $\text{b} \ne \text{d}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable terms cancel out, leaving a **FALSE statement** (a contradiction).
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{5 = 8}$$
    $$\text{-5 = 10}$$

---

##### 3. Exactly One Solution (Unique Solution) 🎯

This is the standard case, where one specific number satisfies the equation.

* **Condition:** The variable coefficients are **different**.
    * $\text{a} \ne \text{c}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable term remains, allowing you to isolate and solve for the variable.
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{3x = 9}$$
    $$\text{x = 3}$$
#### Quiz 3 (3/5 = 60% - 'x = 11.33' doesn't work, but 'x = 34/3' does, idk, also forgot to reduce a fraction '-28/34' instead needed '-14/17') :

#### Unit Test (7/10 = 70% - When you inverse('-x' into a 'x') a '-' to the other side with the constant, a greater than sign becomes a less than sign - you can divide by variables and constants x(-p+8) in order to balance an equation for finding x, you can also simplify if both the numerator and denominator are negative to make them a positive)
## Unit 3: Working with Units - 2025-10-05 :
#### Unit Test (9/10 = 90% - misread a question, something to do with a microgram μg is 1/1000 of a miligram which is 1/1000th of a gram = 1/1,000,000 millionth of a gram)

#### Quiz 1 (4/6 = 66% - Forgot a '-' negative sign for slope - missclicked on graph (2,2 instead of 2,3) - careless)

#### Quiz 2 (4/5 = 80% - Messed up, and had the position of (y,x) instead of (x,y) for the y intercept - also took a tangent and practiced slope intercept form for almost an hour to do this test )

**Point-Slope Form:**
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
> **Description:** This form allows you to write the equation of a line if you know the slope and only one point. It is derived directly from the Slope Formula.
> **Breakdown:**
> * $m$: The slope.
> * $(x_1, y_1)$: A single, specific point on the line.
> * $(x, y)$: Represents any other point on the line.
> **Usage:** This is the best starting point when given a slope and a point. It can be algebraically rearranged (by distributing $m$ and adding $y_1$) to the Slope-Intercept Form.
##### Linear Equations: Forms and Conversions

| Form | Equation | Purpose | How to Use / Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Point-Slope** | **$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$** | Writing an equation given a **point** and the **slope**. | Requires a known slope ($\mathbf{m}$) and any point ($\mathbf{x_1, y_1}$) on the line. |
| **Slope-Intercept**| $\mathbf{y = mx + b}$ | Graphing and identifying the rate of change. | Easily shows the slope ($\mathbf{m}$) and the **y-intercept** ($\mathbf{b}$). |
| **Standard** | $\mathbf{Ax + By = C}$ | Often used for systems of equations; A, B, and C are integers; A is typically positive. | Slope ($\mathbf{m}$) is found by calculating **$-\frac{A}{B}$**. |

##### Key Concepts from Practice

###### 1. Slope Formula
The slope ($\mathbf{m}$) between any two points $(\mathbf{x_1, y_1})$ and $(\mathbf{x_2, y_2})$ is:
$$\mathbf{m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$$

###### 2. Parallel and Perpendicular Slopes
* **Parallel Lines:** Have the **same slope** ($\mathbf{m_1 = m_2}$).
* **Perpendicular Lines:** Have slopes that are **negative reciprocals** ($\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$).

###### 3. Conversion Example (Standard to Point-Slope)
**Problem:** Write $\mathbf{6x + 3y = 21}$ in point-slope form using the point where $\mathbf{x=2}$.

1.  **Find Slope ($\mathbf{m}$):**
    $3y = -6x + 21 \implies y = -2x + 7$
    $\mathbf{m = -2}$
2.  **Find Point $(\mathbf{x_1, y_1})$:**
    When $x=2$: $y = -2(2) + 7 = 3$
    Point: $(\mathbf{2, 3})$
3.  **Point-Slope Form:**
    $$\mathbf{y - 3 = -2(x - 2)}$$
