#### Quiz 2 (4/5 = 80% - for fractions, pressing 'enter' hands it in) :

#### Quiz 1 (4/5 = 80% - added when I should of subtracted):

#### Quiz 2 (4/5 = 80% - apparently '50 = 50' is an infinite number of solutions) :

#### Quiz 3 (3/5 = 60% - 'x = 11.33' doesn't work, but 'x = 34/3' does, idk, also forgot to reduce a fraction '-28/34' instead needed '-14/17') :

#### Unit Test (7/10 = 70% - When you inverse('-x' into a 'x') a '-' to the other side with the constant, a greater than sign becomes a less than sign - you can divide by variables and constants x(-p+8) in order to balance an equation for finding x, you can also simplify if both the numerator and denominator at negative to make them a positive - )
##### üéØ Linear Equations: Determining the Number of Solutions

To determine the number of solutions for a linear equation in the form $\text{ax} + \text{b} = \text{cx} + \text{d}$, always **fully simplify** the equation first. The result of the simplification determines the solution set.

##### 1. Infinitely Many Solutions (All Real Numbers) ‚ôæÔ∏è

This means **any** real number will satisfy the original equation.

* **Condition:** The coefficients and the constants on both sides are **identical** after simplifying.
    * $\text{a} = \text{c}$ **AND** $\text{b} = \text{d}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable terms cancel out, leaving a **TRUE statement** (a mathematical identity).
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{0 = 0}$$
    $$\text{10z + 1 = 10z + 1}$$

---

##### 2. No Solutions üö´

This means **no** real number can satisfy the original equation.

* **Condition:** The variable coefficients are the **same**, but the constants are **different**.
    * $\text{a} = \text{c}$ **BUT** $\text{b} \ne \text{d}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable terms cancel out, leaving a **FALSE statement** (a contradiction).
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{5 = 8}$$
    $$\text{-5 = 10}$$

---

##### 3. Exactly One Solution (Unique Solution) üéØ

This is the standard case, where one specific number satisfies the equation.

* **Condition:** The variable coefficients are **different**.
    * $\text{a} \ne \text{c}$
* **Result of Simplification:** The variable term remains, allowing you to isolate and solve for the variable.
* **Example Result:**
    $$\text{3x = 9}$$
    $$\text{x = 3}$$
