## Algebra II - Lesson 1 - Sets 1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
- 'Finite Sets' = have a specific number of elements
- 'Infinite Sets' =  have an unlimited amount of elements
- $\subset$ : 'SubSets' = will contain elements of the main set, 
- $A \subset B$ : 'A' is a 'Proper Subset' of 'B', A = {1, 7, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- $\subseteq$ : 'Improper Subsets' = if 2 sets are equal (have exactly the same elements in different orders) they are considered an 'Improper Subset', G = {1, 8, 2}, D = {2, 1, 8}
- $A \subseteq B$ : 'G' is an 'Improper Subset' of 'D'
- $\mathbf{\not\subset}$ : 'Not a Subset Of' = Symbol for not a subset of, fora set to be a subset of another set, it MUST contain ALL elements from the main set (if even one is missing, it is not a subset)
- $Q \mathbf{\not\subset} L$ : 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L', Q = {a, m, n, o}, L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}, since 'm' is not in the main set 'L' , 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L'
- $2^n$ = How many subsets can be made from a given set, where 'n' is the number of elements in the main set, $\emptyset$ counts as a set (considered a 'possible set')
### Universal Set Example

**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10.

**Universal Set (U):**
$$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$
$$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

---

**Subsets of U:**

**Set A (Even numbers):**
$$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$
$$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$

**Set B (Numbers less than 5):**
$$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$
$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$

**Set C (Odd numbers):**
$$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

---

**Set Notation (Relationships):**

* **Is a member of:** $5 \in U$
* **Is NOT a member of:** $12 \notin U$
* **Is a subset of:** $B \subset U$
* **No solution/Empty Set:** $A \cap C = \emptyset$ (The intersection of A and C is the empty set)

- 'Venn Diagram' = A way to visually represent the relationship between sets
- $\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$ : 'A Complement' or 'A Prime' of Set A (Elements NOT in A) = Will contain all the elements in set 'U' (Universal Set) that ARE NOT members of 'Set A'
- $\cup$  : 'Union' = Will contain everything of the sets that are united(unionized?), without double listing elements
- $A \cup B$ :  Will contain ALL the elements of set 'A' and 'B' without double listing them
-  $\cap$ : 'Intersection' = will contain only the terms in BOTH SETS that are intersected
-  $A \cap B$ : Intersection of set 'A' and 'B' = will contain only the terms that are in BOTH SETS
### Set Operations for Union and Intersection :

**Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$
**Set A:** $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
**Set B:** $$B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

| Symbol/Operation | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$** | **'A Complement'** (Elements NOT in A) = All elements in $U$ that are NOT in $A$. | $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ |
| **$$\cup$$** | **'Union'** = Combine all elements from the sets, without listing duplicates. | $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ |
| **$$A \cup B$$** | Will contain **ALL** the elements of set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}$$ |
| **$$\cap$$** | **'Intersection'** = Contains **only** the elements common to both sets. | $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$ |
| **$$A \cap B$$** | **Intersection of** set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{4, 5\}}$$ |
## Algebra II - Lesson 3 - Solving Linear Equations - 14October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=41m5s
- $ax + b = c$ : first degree linear equation (since 'a' is raised to the first power of 'x')
- 'a', 'b', and 'c' are representing real numbers, 'a' is the coefficient to 'x' and can not be 0
- $2x + 3 = 9$ , $x = 3$ , when you plug in '3' in to x for the equation, it should create a true statement (9=9)
- **'Addition Property Of Equality'** = You can add the same value to both sides of the equation, and it will not effect the solution
- **'Multiplication Property of Equality'** = if you multiply(or divide) one side, you need to mutliply(or divide) the other side as well with the same non-zero number, it will not effect the solution 
- **Steps to Solve** : 1) Simplify Each Side Seperately, 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation, 3) Isolate the Variable, 4) Check the solution in the original equation (To check, just plug in the value you get and check if the equality still holds true)
- Find x : Your main goal is to isolate the variable
## Algebra II - Lesson 4 - Solving Linear Equations in One Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=59m
- To clear an equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by the **LCD (Lowest common denominator)** of alll fractions - clear the equation of fractions to make it easier to get the answer (this isn't mandatory, just makes it easier to work with)
- Problem 1) (completed below, added to anki)

$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$
- $5 x 4 = 20$ , so the LCD is 20, so multiply both sides of the equation by 20, worked equation below 
- The LCD is the smallest number divisible by all these denominators.
- Problem 2) (added to anki)
$$2\left[x - \frac{5}{3}\right] = \frac{11}{3} - \frac{3x}{2}$$
- Similarly when an equation contains decimals, we can clear the decimals by multiplying both sides by the appropriate power of 10
- Problem 3) (completed below, added to anki)
$$-1.8x -2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$
- A good rule to use, is that if you have an equation with decimals, involved, use decimals as the answer - If you have an equation with fractions involved, use fractions as the answer, etc. 
- For most problems with decimals, you just need to use a calculator, and don't have to clear the decimal place, unless explicitly told to show your work, so you will rarely run into these, you should still know how to do it, though
- Problem 4)
$$1.4y - 2.359 = -0.607 - 0.06y$$
- **'Conditional Equation'** = An equation that has exactly one solution ($5x + 1 = 31$ only $x=6$ is a correct answer, where '31 = 31', if you plug any other number in for x, you will not get a true statement)
- '**Contradiction'** = An equation with no solution is referred to as a contradiction (if the 'x' terms cancel eachother out in the equation, so there is no 'x', that is a contradiction, and it will produce a 'false statement' and has 'no solution')
- **'Identity'**= An equation with an unlimited/infinite number of solutions is called an identity ($6-8x=3(2-x)-5x$, $6-8x=6-8x$, $6 = 6$, a true statement and there are an infinite number of solutions where 'x' can be anything)

### Problem 1) Clearing Fractions by Multiplying by the LCD (20)

**Original Equation (Based on visual inspection):**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

**LCD:** The least common multiple of the denominators (5, 4, 5, 5, 2) is **20**.

**Step 1: Multiply every term by the LCD, 20.**
$$20(-x) + 20\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) = 20\left(\frac{-21}{4}\right) + 20\left(\frac{14x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - 20\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$

**Step 2: Cancel denominators and multiply the remainders.**
* $20(-x) = \mathbf{-20x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(x) = \mathbf{4x}$
* $20/4 = 5 \implies 5(-21) = \mathbf{-105}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(14x) = \mathbf{56x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(3) = \mathbf{12}$
* $20/2 = 10 \implies -10(x) = \mathbf{-10x}$

**Intermediate Result (No Fractions):**
$$-20x + 4x = -105 + 56x + 12 - 10x$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms on each side.**
* **Left Side (x-terms):** $-20x + 4x = \mathbf{-16x}$
* **Right Side (x-terms):** $56x - 10x = \mathbf{46x}$
* **Right Side (Constants):** $-105 + 12 = \mathbf{-93}$

**Final Equation Ready to Solve:**
$$-16x = 46x - 93$$
**Step 1: Isolate x-terms by subtracting 46x from both sides.** $$-16x - 46x = -93$$ $$-62x = -93$$ **Step 2: Solve for x by dividing both sides by -62.** $$x = \frac{-93}{-62}$$ **Step 3: Simplify the fraction.** Both 93 and 62 are divisible by 31 (since $93 = 3 \times 31$ and $62 = 2 \times 31$). The negative signs cancel. $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$ $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$ **Check for Excluded Values:** The original denominators were 5, 4, 5, 5, and 2. Since none of the original denominators contained the variable $x$, there are **no excluded values ($\emptyset$)**. Therefore, the solution is valid. **Final Solution:** $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$
### Problem 1) Solving the Equation WITHOUT a Full LCD Strategy = Same Result, more steps, harder

**Original Equation:**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

***

**Step 1: Simplify the Left Side (Common Denominator is 5).**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-5x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} = \mathbf{\frac{-4x}{5}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify Constants on the Right Side (Common Denominator is 5 for the two constant fractions).**
$$\frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \left( \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} \right)$$
*Combine constants with common denominator 20:*
$$\frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{-21 \cdot 5}{20} + \frac{3 \cdot 4}{20} = \frac{-105 + 12}{20} = \mathbf{\frac{-93}{20}}$$

**New Equation:**
$$\frac{-4x}{5} = \frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 3: Move all x-terms to the Left Side.**

$$\frac{-4x}{5} - \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

**Step 4: Combine the first two x-terms (Common Denominator 5).**
$$\frac{-4x - 14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-18x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 5: Combine the remaining x-terms (Common Denominator is 10).**
$$\frac{-18x \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 2} + \frac{x \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-36x}{10} + \frac{5x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-31x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 6: Solve for x.**

1.  **Cross-Multiply (Allowed because it's Fraction = Fraction):**
    $$-31x \cdot 20 = -93 \cdot 10$$
    $$-620x = -930$$

2.  **Divide both sides by -620:**
    $$x = \frac{-930}{-620}$$
    $$x = \frac{93}{62}$$

3.  **Simplify (Divide by 31):**
    $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$

**Final Solution:**
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 1: Linear Equations - Clearing Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Multiply the entire equation by 100 (LCD of 1, 10, 100).**
$$100(-1.8x - 2.06x) = 100(-2.9x + 2.4)$$

**Resulting Integer Equation:**
$$-180x - 206x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 2: Combine Like Terms.**
$$-386x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 3: Isolate x-terms (Add 290x to both sides).**
$$-386x + 290x = 240$$
$$-96x = 240$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -96).**
$$x = \frac{240}{-96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify (Divide numerator and denominator by 48).**
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 2: Linear Equations - Solving with Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Combine Like Terms on the Left Side.**
$$(-1.8 - 2.06)x = -3.86x$$
$$-3.86x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 2: Isolate x-terms (Add 2.9x to both sides).**
$$-3.86x + 2.9x = 2.4$$

**Step 3: Combine x-terms.**
$$(-3.86 + 2.9)x = -0.96x$$
$$-0.96x = 2.4$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -0.96).**
$$x = \frac{2.4}{-0.96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify to Fraction/Decimal.**
*(To simplify the calculation, temporarily multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: $\frac{240}{-96}$)*
$$x = -\frac{240}{96}$$
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 5 - Converting a Repeating Decimal into a Fraction - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h30m20s
- **Repeating Decimal** = A decimal that repeats the same digit or pattern of digits forever.
- Examples of Repeating Decimals :

|    Fraction     |     Decimal Representation     | Read As                                                |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|  $\frac{1}{3}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{3}}$      | Zero point three repeating                             |
|  $\frac{1}{6}$  |     $0.1\mathbf{\bar{6}}$      | Zero point one six repeating                           |
|  $\frac{1}{9}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{1}}$      | Zero point one repeating                               |
| $\frac{2}{11}$  |   $0.\mathbf{\overline{18}}$   | Zero point one eight repeating                         |
| $\frac{5}{12}$  |     $0.41\mathbf{\bar{6}}$     | Zero point four one six repeating                      |
|  $\frac{1}{7}$  | $0.\mathbf{\overline{142857}}$ | Zero point one four two eight five seven repeating     |
| $\frac{44}{45}$ |   $0.9\mathbf{\overline{7}}$   | Zero point nine seven, repeating infinitely, of course |
- 44/45 = 0.97 repeating = he does a bunch of things where he multiplies the equation by 10, get's 8.8, then subtract x, then multiply by 10(again), then divide by 90.... bro, just round up or down, this is tedious just watching, I'm not typing all that out
- $10^n$ where $^n$ is the number of digits in the repeating string (so if 2 digits repeat infinitely, then do 2, etc)
## Algebra II - Lesson 6 - Solving for a Specified Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h48m45s
- d = rt (distance = rate * time)
- r = d/t (rate of speed = distance / time)
- t = d/r (time = distance / rate)
- You can manipulate your formulas to get what you need out of it
- p = 2l + 2w (perimeter of a rectangle = 2 Length + 2 Width)
-  p = 40 feet, w = 7 feet, you can now solve the equation to find the missing variable
- f = 9/5c + 32 (fahrenheit = 9/5 celsius + 32)
- multiply a fraction by its reciprocal to cancel it out 9/5c * 5/9c, what you do on one side do on the other
- 5/9(f-32) = c
## Algebra II - Lesson 7 - Applications of Linear Equations I - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h9m10s
- how to decode word problems so they make sense, and you can turn them into an equation to use :
- **Common Addition Phrases** = 'The Sum Of', 'More Than', 'Plus', 'Added to', 'Increased by', 
- **Phrases for Subtraction** = 'Less than', 'Less', 'Decreased by', 'Minus', 'Subtracted From'
- **Phrases for Multiplication** = 'Times', 'Multiplied by', 'Of'(fractions), 'Product of'
- **Phrases for Division** = 'Quotient of', 'Divided by', 
- **Is Means Equals** = Is = Equals
- **Commutative** = placement doesn't matter, addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and division are not (the order matters where you put the '-' or '/' sign on the terms), so take your time when you are reading so you know where to place the symbols correctly, how many times have I gotten something wrong because I left out a '-' or forgot to simplify
## Algebra II - Lesson 8 - Applications of Linear Equations II - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h30m
- There are generally only 3 types of word problems you will run into during Algebra I / II
- 6 Step Process to Solving a word problem :
1) Read the problem and determine the question(s) to be answered
2) Assign a variable to represent the unknown, sometimes more than one unknown
3) Write an equation
4) Solve an equation
5) Write the answer in terms of the question(s) asked 
6) Check the answer using the words of the problem
- Problem 1) Marci and Steven are siblings. Marci is four years older than Steven. If their combined age is 34, how old is Marci? How old is Steven? 
  **'S' = Stevens Age, 
  'M' = Marcis Age(S +4).**  
  $S + (S+4) = 34$ 
  $2S + 4 = 34$
  $2S = 30$
  $S = 15$
  Steven is 15 years old, while Marci is 19 years old. 
  Doing it starting with Marcis age :
  M = S + S - 4 = 34 
  2S = 38
  M = 19
  M - 4 = S
  S = 15
- Problem 2) During the **16-game** 2012 NFL regular season, **the Broncos, Chargers, and Raiders combined to win a total of 24 games.** The Chargers won 3 more games than the Raiders but won 6 fewer games than the Broncos. Find the regular season win/loss record for each team. 
  **X =  Number of games won by the chargers**
  **X - 3 = Number of games won by the raiders**
  **X+6 = Number of games won by the broncos**
  $X + X -3 + X + 6 = 24$
  3X + 3 = 24
  3X = 21
  X = 7 
  There are 7 games won by the chargers and lost 9 games, 4 games won by the raiders and lost 12, and 13 games won by the broncos and lost 3. 
- Problem 3)  Mark's retail clothing store currently has an inventory level of $585,000. This was an increase of 150% from one year ago. How much was the value of the inventory one year ago?
  **X = The value of inventory one year ago**
  X + 1.5X = 585,000$
  2.5X = 585,000$
  X = 234,000$
  The value of the inventory one year ago was 234,000$
- Problem 4) (added to anki) Gene invested $2000 for 3 years and earned a total of $300 in simple interest. What was his interest rate?
  **I = prt**, I = interest, p = principal, r = rate, t = time
  I / pt = r 
  300 / (2000)(3) = r
  r = 0.05 
  The interest rate was 5%.
## Algebra II - Lesson 9 - Applications of Linear Equations III - 17October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h53m36s
- Problem 1) (added to anki) An alcohol solution was made by mixing **3 gallons of an 80% alcohol solution** and **4 gallons of a 52% alcohol solution**. Find the concentratiowf the new mixture. 
   $\frac{Pure amount of the substance}{Total amount of the mixture} = concentration of the substance$ Pure amount of the substance / Total amount of the mixture = concentration of the substance (mathjax formattingiswierd)
   3 Gallons of 80% = 3 * 0.8 = 2.4 gallons
   4 gallons of 52% = 4 * 0.52 = 2.08 gallons
   $\frac{2.4 + 2.08}{3 + 4}$ = 0.64 = 64%
   The new mixture is 64% alcohol
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
### Problem 2) Mixture Problem: Solving for Fruit Punch Gallons
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?

**Goal:** Create 12 gallons of 48% fruit juice.
**Mixtures:** Betty's (38% juice) and Calvin's (53% juice).

---

#### 1. Define Variables

Let $B$ be the number of gallons of **Betty's** juice (38%).
Let $C$ be the number of gallons of **Calvin's** juice (53%).

---

#### 2. Set Up the System of Equations

We need two equations: one for the **Total Volume** and one for the **Total Amount of Pure Juice**.

**Equation 1: Total Volume (Gallons)**
The gallons of Betty's plus the gallons of Calvin's must equal the final 12 gallons.
$$B + C = 12$$

**Equation 2: Total Pure Juice (Juice Content)**
The amount of pure juice from Betty's ($0.38B$) plus the amount of pure juice from Calvin's ($0.53C$) must equal the amount of pure juice in the final mixture ($48\%$ of 12 gallons).
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 0.48(12)$$
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 5.76$$

---

#### 3. Solve the System (Using Substitution)

It's easiest to solve Equation 1 for $B$ and substitute it into Equation 2.

**A. Isolate B (from Eq 1):**
$$B = 12 - C$$

**B. Substitute (12 - C) into Eq 2:**
$$0.38(12 - C) + 0.53C = 5.76$$

**C. Distribute and Simplify:**
$$4.56 - 0.38C + 0.53C = 5.76$$
$$4.56 + 0.15C = 5.76$$

**D. Isolate C (Subtract 4.56 from both sides):**
$$0.15C = 5.76 - 4.56$$
$$0.15C = 1.20$$

**E. Solve for C (Divide by 0.15):**
$$C = \frac{1.20}{0.15}$$
$$\mathbf{C = 8 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 4. Find B (Substitute C=8 back into B = 12 - C)

$$B = 12 - 8$$
$$\mathbf{B = 4 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 5. Final Answer

**Betty's Juice (38%):** 4 gallons
**Calvin's Juice (53%):** 8 gallons

### Problem 3) Word Problem: Multi-Constraint System (Bill Totals)
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?

**Problem Equation:** $$100H + 20T + 1O = 1105$$

**Constraints (in terms of x=T):**
* $T = x$
* $H = T/6 \implies H = x/6$
* $O = T - 25 \implies O = x - 25$

---

#### 1. Formulate the Equation

Substitute all variables into the value equation:
$$100\left(\frac{x}{6}\right) + 20x + (x - 25) = 1105$$

#### 2. Simplify and Solve

**A. Simplify Coefficients:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 20x + x - 25 = 1105$$

**B. Combine $x$ terms and move constant:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 21x = 1105 + 25$$
$$\frac{50x}{3} + \frac{63x}{3} = 1130$$

**C. Combine fractions:**
$$\frac{113x}{3} = 1130$$

**D. Solve for x:**
$$113x = 3390$$
$$x = \frac{3390}{113}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 30}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

* $T = x = 30$ (Twenties)
* $H = x/6 = 30/6 = 5$ (Hundreds)
* $O = x - 25 = 30 - 25 = 5$ (Ones)
### Problem 4) Word Problem: Uniform Motion (Catch-Up Time)
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
**Goal:** Find the average rate of speed ($P$) of the passenger plane.

**Key Principle:** The distance traveled by both planes is equal ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$).

---

#### 1. Determine Time and Rate Variables

| Plane | Rate (R) | Time (T) | Distance (D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passenger (P)** | $P$ | $7 \text{ hrs} + 2 \text{ hrs} = 9$ | $9P$ |
| **Cargo (C)** | $P + 80$ | $7$ hrs | $7(P + 80)$ |

---

#### 2. Set Up the Equation ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$)

$$9P = 7(P + 80)$$

#### 3. Solve for P

**A. Distribute:**
$$9P = 7P + 560$$

**B. Isolate the variable:** Subtract $7P$ from both sides.
$$9P - 7P = 560$$
$$2P = 560$$

**C. Final Division:**
$$P = \frac{560}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{P = 280}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

The passenger plane's average rate of speed was **280 mph**.

## Algebra II - Lesson 10 - Interval Notation - 17October2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=12361s
- **Interval Notation** = Allows us to notate a specific range of numbers on a number line
- **Set Builder Notation** = { x | x has a certain property } syntax
- {x | -2 < x < 5 } = The set of all elements in set X  such that x is greater than -2 and less than 5
- {x | x = 7 } = Set builder notation for saying 'the set of all elements x | such that x = 7'
- x > 7 = you can use an open circle on a number line or a parnthesis '(' and shade on the number line to indicate that it continues
- X >= 5 = x greater than equal to 5 = use a filled in circle or a '[' bracket and shade after to show the solution region
- x < 3 = use an open circle or a parenthesis ')' and shade before 
- x <= -4 = x is less than equal to negative 4 = filled in circle or bracket ']' and shade everything to the left
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- $(-\infty, 5]$  Negative infinity, less than equal to 5, note that infinity needs a negative sign and a parenthesis
## Algebra II - Lesson 11 - Linear Inequalities in One Variable - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=13687s
- $ax+b<c$ : a, b, and c are real numbers. a is not allowed to be 0. 
- The main difference between an equation('=') and inequalitie is the greater/less than symbol
- Same as always, you are trying to find 'x', isolate the value by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing
- **The Multiplication Property of Inequality** = If you multiply both sides by any non-zero positive number, it won't effect the final solution. *If you multiply both sides by a negative number, YOU MUST FLIP THE DIRECTION OF THE INEQUALITY SYMBOL* : Also when you are *dividing by a negative, you need to flip the signs as well*
- big number not always bigger says grug, -2 > -5,  -5 is still the smaller number
- **Interval Notation** = (smallest value, largest value), so if x <= 6 = $(-\infty, 6]$, the ']' bracket indicates that six is part of the solution, always use a parenthesis with infinity
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- To check your inequality : Change the inequality to '=' and check if 'x' is = to a true statement, establish solution and non solution regions/boundaries, then check one on each side, tedious
- Graphing : same as above, this video is largely just review, open circle excluded, fully filled circle for included or use parenthesis/brackets, and shade the solution area
- **Three Part Inequality** = '8 < 8 -5a < 38' : '8 -5a' is greater than 8, and less than 38, both conditions need to be met, 2 options : seperate and solve and put back together, or solve and do same thing to each part by isolating 'a' in middle and do everything to both sides : subtract '8' from both sides and divide both sides by '-5' to isolate, since you are dividing by a negative, the equality signs must flip : '0 > a > -6', but you need to rearrange, so, flip the symbols again, '-6 < a < 0' = 'a' is greater than negative six and less than 0 : or (-6, 0) for interval notation
## Algebra II - Lesson 12 - Compound Inequalities - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=4h19m
- **Compound Inequality** = A compound inequality consists of two inequalities linked by **And** or **Or**
- **And** inequality how to solve steps : 1) Solve each inequality seperately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *both inequalities* - if you don't get a solution that can satisfy BOTH inequalities / overlap - then you have NO SOLUTION
- **Or** inequalities and how to solve steps : 1) solve each inequality separately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *either inequality* - if you have an element that is common to both, list it only once. The *union* of the two sets.
### Compound Inequalities

**Definition:** Two or more inequalities joined by the words **AND** or **OR**.

| Type | Definition | Solution Set |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AND** | The variable must satisfy **BOTH** inequalities. (Intersection) | The overlapping region on the number line. |
| **OR** | The variable must satisfy **AT LEAST ONE** of the inequalities. (Union) | All regions covered by either inequality. |

---

#### Case 1: "AND" Compound Inequality (Intersection)

**Problem:** Solve $-5 < 2x + 1 \le 11$

**Step 1: Isolate the variable ($x$) in the middle.**
* Subtract 1 from all three parts:
    $$-5 - 1 < 2x + 1 - 1 \le 11 - 1$$
    $$-6 < 2x \le 10$$

**Step 2: Solve for $x$.**
* Divide all three parts by 2:
    $$\frac{-6}{2} < \frac{2x}{2} \le \frac{10}{2}$$
    $$\mathbf{-3 < x \le 5}$$

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Overlap):**
* Since $x$ must be greater than $-3$ AND less than or equal to $5$, the solution is a single interval.
    $$\mathbf{(-3, 5]}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid -3 < x \le 5\}}$$

---

#### Case 2: "OR" Compound Inequality (Union)

**Problem:** Solve $3x + 4 \le 10$ **OR** $x - 7 > 2$

**Step 1: Solve each inequality separately.**

| Left Inequality (OR) | Right Inequality (OR) |
| :--- | :--- |
| $3x + 4 \le 10$ | $x - 7 > 2$ |
| $3x \le 6$ | $x > 9$ |
| $\mathbf{x \le 2}$ | $\mathbf{x > 9}$ |

**Step 2: Combine the solutions using "OR".**
* The solution includes all values $\le 2$ *plus* all values $> 9$.

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Combined Regions):**
* Use the **Union** symbol ($\cup$) to join the two separate intervals.
    $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 2] \cup (9, \infty)}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \le 2 \text{ or } x > 9\}}$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=5h30m40s
- Where? How? **Absolute Value** means the distance away from '0' so you need a positive and negative. 
- For absolute value inequalities, you will need a negative AND a positive for each one - **The sign will also be flipped when doing the opposite values** 
- *When dividing or multiplying by a negative, don't forget to FLIP the sign*
- For > greater than you need to use an 'OR' with a compound inequality, for < less than you need to use an 'AND' to get the correct solution sets, formulas/syntax below :
- |x| > k : x > k OR x < -k
- |x| < k : x < k AND x > -k
- Make sure you ISOLATE the absolute value operation as much as you can before making your inequality statements, aka clear everything OUTSIDE of the '| |' absolutes must be worked into the inequality, for example : '7|10k + 3| + 7 < 28' should be worked down to : '|10k +3| < 3' BEFORE doing your 'AND' or 'OR' statements
- Problem 1) (added to anki)
   |x| $\ge$ 2 : So you will need both a negative and positive for these as well, so $(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)$ is the solution set (any number that is less than $\le$ -2 Union with any number that is  $\ge$ greater than equal to 2)

## Algebra II - Lesson 15 - Linear Equations in Two Variables - 20October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h3m10s
- Linear equations with only one variable generally only have one answer (find x, oh look, there it is) - with 2 variables, there is no longer one solution, there is an infinite number of solutions
- **Standard Form of a Linear Equation** : **ax + by = c** A linear equation in two variables is of the form : **ax + by = c** , 'a' 'b' and 'c' are real numbers, 'a' and 'b' can not be '0' zero at the same time
- If there are exponents (besides ^1), then it is not a linear equation. For example :  $ax^2 + by^2 = c$ is not a linear equation
- **Ordered Pair** = A solution to a linear equation in two variables is called an ordered pair : **(x, y)** - *'X' is always first, 'Y' is always second*
- To solve a linear equation with 2 variables, plug in a number for one of the variables, and solve for the other one. - Pick something for 'X', solve for 'Y'. Pick something for 'Y', solve for 'X'
- **Table of Values** : Many ordered pairs, used for graphing, if a value for 'x' is -, you get - for 'Y'  
### Table of Values for $4x - 3y = -12$

| $x$ | $y$ | Calculation |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **0** | **4** | $4(0) - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -12 \implies y = 4$ |
| **-3** | **0** | $4x - 3(0) = -12 \implies 4x = -12 \implies x = -3$ |
| **3** | **8** | $4(3) - 3y = -12 \implies 12 - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -24 \implies y = 8$ |

**Completed Points:** $(0, 4)$, $(-3, 0)$, and $(3, 8)$.

### Table of Values for $-x + 7y = 28$

|  $x$   |  $y$  | Calculation                                                            |
| :----: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7**  | **5** | $-7 + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 35 \implies y = 5$                         |
| **-7** | **3** | $-x + 7(3) = 28 \implies -x + 21 = 28 \implies -x = 7 \implies x = -7$ |
| **0**  | **4** | $-(0) + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 28 \implies y = 4$                       |
**Completed Points:** $(7, 5)$, $(-7, 3)$, and $(0, 4)$.

- What do you with your ordered pairs? You plot them on your **coordinate plane** aka graphing
- **Cartesian Coordinate System** = sum ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum. A fancy way to say graph
- **Rectangular Coordinate System** = yet another name for a graph
- **Origin** = **(0, 0)** 
- **X-Axis** = Goes left to right, Horizontal
- **Y-Axis** = Goes up and down, Vertical
- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)

- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)
- After plotting your ordered pairs, you should get a line, draw a line through it, with arrows to indicate that it keeps going, commonly you would label the line with the equation
- **X Intercept** = Where your graph crosses the X-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'x' and solve for 'y'
- **Y-Intercept** = Where your graph cross the Y-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'y' and solve for 'x'
- **The Intercept Method** = '0' is easy to work with, so just find the 'x intercept' and 'y intercept' - you can graph it with just 2 points, but you want one arbitrary point as a check, you want to end up with integers, not decimals or fractions
- **ax + by +c(0)** We often see equations whose 'x' and 'y' intercepts occurs at the origin (0,0), this will always have a 'c'= 0 zero
- **y = k**  = Graphing horizontal lines will have an equation like this - Y will always be the same, no matter what (it's flat, horizontal straight line, forever), no matter what you plug in for 'x' it will always be the same 'y'
- **x = k** = Graphing a vertical line will have an equation like this, since 'y = 0', x will always have the same value, and be vertical
### Graphing $-x + 4y = -4$ using the Intercept Method

**Equation:** $-x + 4y = -4$

---

#### 1. Find the x-intercept (Set $y = 0$)

* Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-x + 4(0) = -4$$
    $$-x = -4$$
    $$x = 4$$
* **x-intercept point:** **$(4, 0)$**

---

#### 2. Find the y-intercept (Set $x = 0$)

* Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-(0) + 4y = -4$$
    $$4y = -4$$
    $$y = -1$$
* **y-intercept point:** **$(0, -1)$**

---

#### 3. Plotting Points and Check Point

* **Plot these two intercepts:** $(4, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.
* Draw a straight line connecting them.

* **Check Point:** $(8, 1)$
    * Substitute $x = 8$ and $y = 1$ into the original equation:
        $$-(8) + 4(1) = -4$$
        $$-8 + 4 = -4$$
        $$-4 = -4 \quad \checkmark$$
    * Since $-4 = -4$, the point $(8, 1)$ **is on the line**. This confirms our line is drawn correctly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h54m
- **Slope** = $\frac{Rise}{Run}$ = The ratio of vertical change (Rise) to horizontal change (Run) 
- **Slope Formula from 2 points** = $m = \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$ = 'm' stands for slope, $x1 -x2 \neq 0$, You can not divide by 0, so make sure the 2 points you pick don't equal 0 when subtracted
- **Subscript** = $y2$ = y sub 2 = the number after the variable is called a subscript - the order you place the subscripts on the ordered pairs (x, y) doesn't matter, you will get the same result regardless, just be consistent
- $m = -\frac{5}{8}$ if the slope is negative, you can swap it, if the rise goes down 5, the run is eight, if the rise goes up 5, the run goes back 8 - a negative value on y = you are going down, a negative value on the x means it goes to the left
- y = 3 : The slope of any horizontal line is always zero - no matter what you choose for 'x', 'y' is always 3
- x = -4 : The slope of a vertical line is 'undefined' (since you are dividing by 0)
- $+\frac{3}{5}$ = A positively sloped line rises as we move to the right (x+, y+)
- $+\frac{3}{2}$a negatively sloped line goes down as we move to the right (x+, y-)
- $y = mx + b$ = slope intercept form, 'm' is the slope, 'b' is the y intercept - so just solve the equation for 'y' and the coefficient of 'x' is the slope
### Slope Calculation : (-13,2) (19,-18)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-13, 2) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -13, y_1 = 2$$
$$P_2 = (19, -18) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 19, y_2 = -18$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{-18 - 2}{19 - (-13)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{-20}{19 + 13}$$
$$m = \frac{-20}{32}$$

**Step 3: Reduce the fraction.**
*Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF (4):*
$$m = \frac{-20 \div 4}{32 \div 4}$$
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{5}{8}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{5}{8}$$
### Slope Calculation (15, -10) (10, 6)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (15, -10) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = 15, y_1 = -10$$
$$P_2 = (10, 6) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 10, y_2 = 6$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{6 - (-10)}{10 - 15}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{6 + 10}{-5}$$
$$m = \frac{16}{-5}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{16}{5}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{16}{5}$$
### Slope Calculation (-7, -9) (-14, 12)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-7, -9) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -7, y_1 = -9$$
$$P_2 = (-14, 12) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = -14, y_2 = 12$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{12 - (-9)}{-14 - (-7)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{12 + 9}{-14 + 7}$$
$$m = \frac{21}{-7}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -3}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -3$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (x-y = 28)

**Equation:**
$$x - y = 28$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract x from both sides:*
$$-y = -x + 28$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-x + 28)$$
$$y = x - 28$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$y = \mathbf{1}x - 28$$
$$\mathbf{m = 1}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 1$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (6x - y = 8)

**Equation:**
$$6x - y = -8$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $6x$ from both sides:*
$$-y = -6x - 8$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-6x - 8)$$
$$y = 6x + 8$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = 6}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 6$$

- **y = mx + b** : The quickest way to get the slope is to solve for 'y' aka 'slop intercept form'
- Slope intercept form is also the fastest way to graph a linear equation with 2 variables
- **Perpendicular Lines** =  2 perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1, they will intersect at a 90 degree angle $$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$
- **Parralel Lines** = 2 non vertical lines that have the same slope are parallel ( if 2 lines have the same slope, but a different y-intercept, they are parallel)
### Perpendicular Lines Rule

**Rule:** Two non-vertical lines are perpendicular if and only if their slopes ($m_1$ and $m_2$) are **opposite reciprocals**.

**Formula (Condition for Perpendicularity):**
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$

**Alternatively:** The product of their slopes must equal $-1$.
$$\mathbf{m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1}$$

**Steps to Find the Perpendicular Slope:**
1.  **Flip** the original slope (find the reciprocal).
2.  **Change the sign** (find the opposite).

**Example:**
* If $m_1 = \frac{4}{5}$, then $m_2 = -\frac{5}{4}$.
* If $m_1 = -3$, then $m_2 = \frac{1}{3}$.
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (5x - 4y = 12)

**Equation:**
$$5x - 4y = -12$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $5x$ from both sides:*
$$-4y = -5x - 12$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Divide every term on both sides by -4:*
$$\frac{-4y}{-4} = \frac{-5x}{-4} - \frac{12}{-4}$$
$$y = \frac{5}{4}x + 3$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = \frac{5}{4}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = \frac{5}{4}$$
### Solving Linear Equations (x+3y =12) (4x-3y = 3)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$, meaning their slopes are opposite reciprocals.

**Equations:**
1.  $$x + 3y = 12$$
2.  $$4x - 3y = 3$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$x + 3y = 12$$
$$3y = -x + 12$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 4$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$4x - 3y = 3$$
$$-3y = -4x + 3$$
$$y = \frac{-4x}{-3} + \frac{3}{-3}$$
$$y = \frac{4}{3}x - 1$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{3}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{3}$.*

* Are they **opposite reciprocals**?
    * The reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $-3$.
    * The opposite reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $\mathbf{+3}$.
* **Since $\frac{4}{3} \neq 3$**, the lines are **NOT** perpendicular.

---

**Conclusion:**
The slopes are $\mathbf{-\frac{1}{3}}$ and $\mathbf{\frac{4}{3}}$. Since their product is $\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = -\frac{4}{9} \neq -1$, the lines are **NOT perpendicular or parallel**.
### Solving Perpendicular Linear Equations (7x + 4y = 8) (-4x + 7y = -21)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$.

**Equations:**
1.  $$7x + 4y = 8$$
2.  $$-4x + 7y = -21$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$7x + 4y = 8$$
$$4y = -7x + 8$$
$$y = \frac{-7}{4}x + 2$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$-4x + 7y = -21$$
$$7y = 4x - 21$$
$$y = \frac{4}{7}x - 3$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{7}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{7}$.*

* **Opposite Reciprocal Check:**
    * The reciprocal of $\frac{7}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{7}$.
    * The opposite sign of a negative slope is positive.
    * The slopes are indeed opposite reciprocals.

* **Product Check:**
    $$m_1 \cdot m_2 = \left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{7}\right) = \mathbf{-1 \quad (\checkmark)}$$

---

**Conclusion:**
Since $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, the lines are **perpendicular**.

- **Slope-Intercept Form** = **y = mx + b** m = slope (coefficient of 'x) + b(y intercept)
- **Point - Slope Form** = $\mathbf{y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)}$ : Use this when you know the slope and a single point on the line, or you have 2 points, solve for 'y' and get slope intercept form
- **Standard Form** = $ax + by = c$ : write a and b like that, and 'a' or 'b' can not by '0' for standard form, strict definition 'a' 'b' and 'c' are integers (no fractions/decimals) 'a' 'b' 'c' can have no common factor except 1

---

#### 1. Calculate the Slope (m)

---

#### 1. Start with Slope-Intercept Form

$$y = mx + b$$
$$y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 2$$

#### 2. Eliminate the Fraction

*To remove the denominator of 2, multiply every term by **2**.*
$$2 \cdot y = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{2}x\right) - 2 \cdot 2$$
$$2y = -3x - 4$$

#### 3. Rearrange to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

### Convert to Standard Form - Equation of a Parallel Line (to Standard Form) (through (-5, 3) - paralllel to : y = -7/5x + 3)

**Given:**
* Point: $\mathbf{(-5, 3)}$
* Parallel to: $\mathbf{y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3}$

**Goal:** Find the equation of the new line in Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$).

---

#### 1. Determine the Slope of the New Line

* **Rule for Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the **same slope**.
* The given line $y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3$ is in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), so its slope is $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.
* Therefore, the slope of our new line is also $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.

---

#### 2. Use Point-Slope Form

* Use the slope $m = -\frac{7}{5}$ and the given point $(x_1, y_1) = (-5, 3)$.
* **Point-Slope Formula:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x - (-5))$$
    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x + 5)$$

---

#### 3. Convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

**A. Distribute the slope:**
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot 5\right)$$
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - 7$$

**B. Eliminate the fraction:**
* Multiply every term by **5** to clear the denominator.
    $$5(y) - 5(3) = 5\left(-\frac{7}{5}x\right) - 5(7)$$
    $$5y - 15 = -7x - 35$$

**C. Rearrange to $Ax + By = C$ (ensure A is positive):**
* Move the $x$-term ($-7x$) to the left side by adding $7x$ to both sides.
* Move the constant term ($-15$) to the right side by adding $15$ to both sides.
    $$7x + 5y - 15 = -35$$
    $$7x + 5y = -35 + 15$$
    $$\mathbf{7x + 5y = -20}$$

---

**Final Equation in Standard Form:**
$$\mathbf{7x + 5y = -20}$$
