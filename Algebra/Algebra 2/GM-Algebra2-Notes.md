## Algebra II - Lesson 1 - Sets 1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
- 'Finite Sets' = have a specific number of elements
- 'Infinite Sets' =  have an unlimited amount of elements
- $\subset$ : 'SubSets' = will contain elements of the main set, 
- $A \subset B$ : 'A' is a 'Proper Subset' of 'B', A = {1, 7, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- $\subseteq$ : 'Improper Subsets' = if 2 sets are equal (have exactly the same elements in different orders) they are considered an 'Improper Subset', G = {1, 8, 2}, D = {2, 1, 8}
- $A \subseteq B$ : 'G' is an 'Improper Subset' of 'D'
- $\mathbf{\not\subset}$ : 'Not a Subset Of' = Symbol for not a subset of, fora set to be a subset of another set, it MUST contain ALL elements from the main set (if even one is missing, it is not a subset)
- $Q \mathbf{\not\subset} L$ : 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L', Q = {a, m, n, o}, L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}, since 'm' is not in the main set 'L' , 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L'
- $2^n$ = How many subsets can be made from a given set, where 'n' is the number of elements in the main set, $\emptyset$ counts as a set (considered a 'possible set')
### Universal Set Example

**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10.

**Universal Set (U):**
$$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$
$$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

---

**Subsets of U:**

**Set A (Even numbers):**
$$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$
$$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$

**Set B (Numbers less than 5):**
$$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$
$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$

**Set C (Odd numbers):**
$$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

---

**Set Notation (Relationships):**

* **Is a member of:** $5 \in U$
* **Is NOT a member of:** $12 \notin U$
* **Is a subset of:** $B \subset U$
* **No solution/Empty Set:** $A \cap C = \emptyset$ (The intersection of A and C is the empty set)

- 'Venn Diagram' = A way to visually represent the relationship between sets
- $\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$ : 'A Complement' or 'A Prime' of Set A (Elements NOT in A) = Will contain all the elements in set 'U' (Universal Set) that ARE NOT members of 'Set A'
- $\cup$  : 'Union' = Will contain everything of the sets that are united(unionized?), without double listing elements
- $A \cup B$ :  Will contain ALL the elements of set 'A' and 'B' without double listing them
-  $\cap$ : 'Intersection' = will contain only the terms in BOTH SETS that are intersected
-  $A \cap B$ : Intersection of set 'A' and 'B' = will contain only the terms that are in BOTH SETS
### Set Operations for Union and Intersection :

**Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$
**Set A:** $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
**Set B:** $$B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

| Symbol/Operation | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$** | **'A Complement'** (Elements NOT in A) = All elements in $U$ that are NOT in $A$. | $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ |
| **$$\cup$$** | **'Union'** = Combine all elements from the sets, without listing duplicates. | $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ |
| **$$A \cup B$$** | Will contain **ALL** the elements of set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}$$ |
| **$$\cap$$** | **'Intersection'** = Contains **only** the elements common to both sets. | $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$ |
| **$$A \cap B$$** | **Intersection of** set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{4, 5\}}$$ |
## Algebra II - Lesson 3 - Solving Linear Equations - 14October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=41m5s
- $ax + b = c$ : first degree linear equation (since 'a' is raised to the first power of 'x')
- 'a', 'b', and 'c' are representing real numbers, 'a' is the coefficient to 'x' and can not be 0
- $2x + 3 = 9$ , $x = 3$ , when you plug in '3' in to x for the equation, it should create a true statement (9=9)
- **'Addition Property Of Equality'** = You can add the same value to both sides of the equation, and it will not effect the solution
- **'Multiplication Property of Equality'** = if you multiply(or divide) one side, you need to mutliply(or divide) the other side as well with the same non-zero number, it will not effect the solution 
- **Steps to Solve** : 1) Simplify Each Side Seperately, 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation, 3) Isolate the Variable, 4) Check the solution in the original equation (To check, just plug in the value you get and check if the equality still holds true)
- Find x : Your main goal is to isolate the variable
## Algebra II - Lesson 4 - Solving Linear Equations in One Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=59m
- To clear an equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by the **LCD (Lowest common denominator)** of alll fractions - clear the equation of fractions to make it easier to get the answer (this isn't mandatory, just makes it easier to work with)
- Problem 1) (completed below, added to anki)

$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$
- $5 x 4 = 20$ , so the LCD is 20, so multiply both sides of the equation by 20, worked equation below 
- The LCD is the smallest number divisible by all these denominators.
- Problem 2) (added to anki)
$$2\left[x - \frac{5}{3}\right] = \frac{11}{3} - \frac{3x}{2}$$
- Similarly when an equation contains decimals, we can clear the decimals by multiplying both sides by the appropriate power of 10
- Problem 3) (completed below, added to anki)
$$-1.8x -2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$
- A good rule to use, is that if you have an equation with decimals, involved, use decimals as the answer - If you have an equation with fractions involved, use fractions as the answer, etc. 
- For most problems with decimals, you just need to use a calculator, and don't have to clear the decimal place, unless explicitly told to show your work, so you will rarely run into these, you should still know how to do it, though
- Problem 4)
$$1.4y - 2.359 = -0.607 - 0.06y$$
- **'Conditional Equation'** = An equation that has exactly one solution ($5x + 1 = 31$ only $x=6$ is a correct answer, where '31 = 31', if you plug any other number in for x, you will not get a true statement)
- '**Contradiction'** = An equation with no solution is referred to as a contradiction (if the 'x' terms cancel eachother out in the equation, so there is no 'x', that is a contradiction, and it will produce a 'false statement' and has 'no solution')
- **'Identity'**= An equation with an unlimited/infinite number of solutions is called an identity ($6-8x=3(2-x)-5x$, $6-8x=6-8x$, $6 = 6$, a true statement and there are an infinite number of solutions where 'x' can be anything)

### Problem 1) Clearing Fractions by Multiplying by the LCD (20)

**Original Equation (Based on visual inspection):**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

**LCD:** The least common multiple of the denominators (5, 4, 5, 5, 2) is **20**.

**Step 1: Multiply every term by the LCD, 20.**
$$20(-x) + 20\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) = 20\left(\frac{-21}{4}\right) + 20\left(\frac{14x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - 20\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$

**Step 2: Cancel denominators and multiply the remainders.**
* $20(-x) = \mathbf{-20x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(x) = \mathbf{4x}$
* $20/4 = 5 \implies 5(-21) = \mathbf{-105}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(14x) = \mathbf{56x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(3) = \mathbf{12}$
* $20/2 = 10 \implies -10(x) = \mathbf{-10x}$

**Intermediate Result (No Fractions):**
$$-20x + 4x = -105 + 56x + 12 - 10x$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms on each side.**
* **Left Side (x-terms):** $-20x + 4x = \mathbf{-16x}$
* **Right Side (x-terms):** $56x - 10x = \mathbf{46x}$
* **Right Side (Constants):** $-105 + 12 = \mathbf{-93}$

**Final Equation Ready to Solve:**
$$-16x = 46x - 93$$
**Step 1: Isolate x-terms by subtracting 46x from both sides.** $$-16x - 46x = -93$$ $$-62x = -93$$ **Step 2: Solve for x by dividing both sides by -62.** $$x = \frac{-93}{-62}$$ **Step 3: Simplify the fraction.** Both 93 and 62 are divisible by 31 (since $93 = 3 \times 31$ and $62 = 2 \times 31$). The negative signs cancel. $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$ $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$ **Check for Excluded Values:** The original denominators were 5, 4, 5, 5, and 2. Since none of the original denominators contained the variable $x$, there are **no excluded values ($\emptyset$)**. Therefore, the solution is valid. **Final Solution:** $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$
### Problem 1) Solving the Equation WITHOUT a Full LCD Strategy = Same Result, more steps, harder

**Original Equation:**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

***

**Step 1: Simplify the Left Side (Common Denominator is 5).**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-5x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} = \mathbf{\frac{-4x}{5}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify Constants on the Right Side (Common Denominator is 5 for the two constant fractions).**
$$\frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \left( \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} \right)$$
*Combine constants with common denominator 20:*
$$\frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{-21 \cdot 5}{20} + \frac{3 \cdot 4}{20} = \frac{-105 + 12}{20} = \mathbf{\frac{-93}{20}}$$

**New Equation:**
$$\frac{-4x}{5} = \frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 3: Move all x-terms to the Left Side.**

$$\frac{-4x}{5} - \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

**Step 4: Combine the first two x-terms (Common Denominator 5).**
$$\frac{-4x - 14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-18x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 5: Combine the remaining x-terms (Common Denominator is 10).**
$$\frac{-18x \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 2} + \frac{x \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-36x}{10} + \frac{5x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-31x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 6: Solve for x.**

1.  **Cross-Multiply (Allowed because it's Fraction = Fraction):**
    $$-31x \cdot 20 = -93 \cdot 10$$
    $$-620x = -930$$

2.  **Divide both sides by -620:**
    $$x = \frac{-930}{-620}$$
    $$x = \frac{93}{62}$$

3.  **Simplify (Divide by 31):**
    $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$

**Final Solution:**
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 1: Linear Equations - Clearing Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Multiply the entire equation by 100 (LCD of 1, 10, 100).**
$$100(-1.8x - 2.06x) = 100(-2.9x + 2.4)$$

**Resulting Integer Equation:**
$$-180x - 206x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 2: Combine Like Terms.**
$$-386x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 3: Isolate x-terms (Add 290x to both sides).**
$$-386x + 290x = 240$$
$$-96x = 240$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -96).**
$$x = \frac{240}{-96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify (Divide numerator and denominator by 48).**
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 2: Linear Equations - Solving with Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Combine Like Terms on the Left Side.**
$$(-1.8 - 2.06)x = -3.86x$$
$$-3.86x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 2: Isolate x-terms (Add 2.9x to both sides).**
$$-3.86x + 2.9x = 2.4$$

**Step 3: Combine x-terms.**
$$(-3.86 + 2.9)x = -0.96x$$
$$-0.96x = 2.4$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -0.96).**
$$x = \frac{2.4}{-0.96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify to Fraction/Decimal.**
*(To simplify the calculation, temporarily multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: $\frac{240}{-96}$)*
$$x = -\frac{240}{96}$$
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 5 - Converting a Repeating Decimal into a Fraction - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h30m20s
- **Repeating Decimal** = A decimal that repeats the same digit or pattern of digits forever.
- Examples of Repeating Decimals :

|    Fraction     |     Decimal Representation     | Read As                                                |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|  $\frac{1}{3}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{3}}$      | Zero point three repeating                             |
|  $\frac{1}{6}$  |     $0.1\mathbf{\bar{6}}$      | Zero point one six repeating                           |
|  $\frac{1}{9}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{1}}$      | Zero point one repeating                               |
| $\frac{2}{11}$  |   $0.\mathbf{\overline{18}}$   | Zero point one eight repeating                         |
| $\frac{5}{12}$  |     $0.41\mathbf{\bar{6}}$     | Zero point four one six repeating                      |
|  $\frac{1}{7}$  | $0.\mathbf{\overline{142857}}$ | Zero point one four two eight five seven repeating     |
| $\frac{44}{45}$ |   $0.9\mathbf{\overline{7}}$   | Zero point nine seven, repeating infinitely, of course |
- 44/45 = 0.97 repeating = he does a bunch of things where he multiplies the equation by 10, get's 8.8, then subtract x, then multiply by 10(again), then divide by 90.... bro, just round up or down, this is tedious just watching, I'm not typing all that out
- $10^n$ where $^n$ is the number of digits in the repeating string (so if 2 digits repeat infinitely, then do 2, etc)
## Algebra II - Lesson 6 - Solving for a Specified Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h48m45s
- d = rt (distance = rate * time)
- r = d/t (rate of speed = distance / time)
- t = d/r (time = distance / rate)
- You can manipulate your formulas to get what you need out of it
- p = 2l + 2w (perimeter of a rectangle = 2 Length + 2 Width)
-  p = 40 feet, w = 7 feet, you can now solve the equation to find the missing variable
- f = 9/5c + 32 (fahrenheit = 9/5 celsius + 32)
- multiply a fraction by its reciprocal to cancel it out 9/5c * 5/9c, what you do on one side do on the other
- 5/9(f-32) = c
## Algebra II - Lesson 7 - Applications of Linear Equations I - 16October2025:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h9m10s
- how to decode word problems so they make sense, and you can turn them into an equation to use :
- **Common Addition Phrases** = 'The Sum Of', 'More Than', 'Plus', 'Added to', 'Increased by', 
- **Phrases for Subtraction** = 'Less than', 'Less', 'Decreased by', 'Minus', 'Subtracted From'
- **Phrases for Multiplication** = 'Times', 'Multiplied by', 'Of'(fractions), 'Product of'
- **Phrases for Division** = 'Quotient of', 'Divided by', 
- **Is Means Equals** = Is = Equals
- **Commutative** = placement doesn't matter, addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and division are not (the order matters where you put the '-' or '/' sign on the terms), so take your time when you are reading so you know where to place the symbols correctly, how many times have I gotten something wrong because I left out a '-' or forgot to simplify
-
