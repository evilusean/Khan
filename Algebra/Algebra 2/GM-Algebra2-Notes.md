## Algebra II - Lesson 1 - Sets 1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
- 'Finite Sets' = have a specific number of elements
- 'Infinite Sets' =  have an unlimited amount of elements
- $\subset$ : 'SubSets' = will contain elements of the main set, 
- $A \subset B$ : 'A' is a 'Proper Subset' of 'B', A = {1, 7, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- $\subseteq$ : 'Improper Subsets' = if 2 sets are equal (have exactly the same elements in different orders) they are considered an 'Improper Subset', G = {1, 8, 2}, D = {2, 1, 8}
- $A \subseteq B$ : 'G' is an 'Improper Subset' of 'D'
- $\mathbf{\not\subset}$ : 'Not a Subset Of' = Symbol for not a subset of, fora set to be a subset of another set, it MUST contain ALL elements from the main set (if even one is missing, it is not a subset)
- $Q \mathbf{\not\subset} L$ : 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L', Q = {a, m, n, o}, L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}, since 'm' is not in the main set 'L' , 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L'
- $2^n$ = How many subsets can be made from a given set, where 'n' is the number of elements in the main set, $\emptyset$ counts as a set (considered a 'possible set')
### Universal Set Example

**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10.

**Universal Set (U):**
$$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$
$$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

---

**Subsets of U:**

**Set A (Even numbers):**
$$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$
$$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$

**Set B (Numbers less than 5):**
$$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$
$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$

**Set C (Odd numbers):**
$$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

---

**Set Notation (Relationships):**

* **Is a member of:** $5 \in U$
* **Is NOT a member of:** $12 \notin U$
* **Is a subset of:** $B \subset U$
* **No solution/Empty Set:** $A \cap C = \emptyset$ (The intersection of A and C is the empty set)

- 'Venn Diagram' = A way to visually represent the relationship between sets
- $\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$ : 'A Complement' or 'A Prime' of Set A (Elements NOT in A) = Will contain all the elements in set 'U' (Universal Set) that ARE NOT members of 'Set A'
- $\cup$  : 'Union' = Will contain everything of the sets that are united(unionized?), without double listing elements
- $A \cup B$ :  Will contain ALL the elements of set 'A' and 'B' without double listing them
-  $\cap$ : 'Intersection' = will contain only the terms in BOTH SETS that are intersected
-  $A \cap B$ : Intersection of set 'A' and 'B' = will contain only the terms that are in BOTH SETS
### Set Operations for Union and Intersection :

**Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$
**Set A:** $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
**Set B:** $$B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

| Symbol/Operation | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$** | **'A Complement'** (Elements NOT in A) = All elements in $U$ that are NOT in $A$. | $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ |
| **$$\cup$$** | **'Union'** = Combine all elements from the sets, without listing duplicates. | $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ |
| **$$A \cup B$$** | Will contain **ALL** the elements of set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}$$ |
| **$$\cap$$** | **'Intersection'** = Contains **only** the elements common to both sets. | $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$ |
| **$$A \cap B$$** | **Intersection of** set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{4, 5\}}$$ |
## Algebra II - Lesson 3 - Solving Linear Equations - 14October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=41m5s
- $ax + b = c$ : first degree linear equation (since 'a' is raised to the first power of 'x')
- 'a', 'b', and 'c' are representing real numbers, 'a' is the coefficient to 'x' and can not be 0
- $2x + 3 = 9$ , $x = 3$ , when you plug in '3' in to x for the equation, it should create a true statement (9=9)
- **'Addition Property Of Equality'** = You can add the same value to both sides of the equation, and it will not effect the solution
- **'Multiplication Property of Equality'** = if you multiply(or divide) one side, you need to mutliply(or divide) the other side as well with the same non-zero number, it will not effect the solution 
- **Steps to Solve** : 1) Simplify Each Side Seperately, 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation, 3) Isolate the Variable, 4) Check the solution in the original equation (To check, just plug in the value you get and check if the equality still holds true)
- Find x : Your main goal is to isolate the variable
## Algebra II - Lesson 4 - Solving Linear Equations in One Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=59m
- To clear an equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by the **LCD (Lowest common denominator)** of alll fractions - clear the equation of fractions to make it easier to get the answer (this isn't mandatory, just makes it easier to work with)
- Problem 1) (completed below, added to anki)

$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$
- $5 x 4 = 20$ , so the LCD is 20, so multiply both sides of the equation by 20, worked equation below 
- The LCD is the smallest number divisible by all these denominators.
- Problem 2) (added to anki)
$$2\left[x - \frac{5}{3}\right] = \frac{11}{3} - \frac{3x}{2}$$
- Similarly when an equation contains decimals, we can clear the decimals by multiplying both sides by the appropriate power of 10
- Problem 3) (completed below, added to anki)
$$-1.8x -2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$
- A good rule to use, is that if you have an equation with decimals, involved, use decimals as the answer - If you have an equation with fractions involved, use fractions as the answer, etc. 
- For most problems with decimals, you just need to use a calculator, and don't have to clear the decimal place, unless explicitly told to show your work, so you will rarely run into these, you should still know how to do it, though
- Problem 4)
$$1.4y - 2.359 = -0.607 - 0.06y$$
- **'Conditional Equation'** = An equation that has exactly one solution ($5x + 1 = 31$ only $x=6$ is a correct answer, where '31 = 31', if you plug any other number in for x, you will not get a true statement)
- '**Contradiction'** = An equation with no solution is referred to as a contradiction (if the 'x' terms cancel eachother out in the equation, so there is no 'x', that is a contradiction, and it will produce a 'false statement' and has 'no solution')
- **'Identity'**= An equation with an unlimited/infinite number of solutions is called an identity ($6-8x=3(2-x)-5x$, $6-8x=6-8x$, $6 = 6$, a true statement and there are an infinite number of solutions where 'x' can be anything)

### Problem 1) Clearing Fractions by Multiplying by the LCD (20)

**Original Equation (Based on visual inspection):**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

**LCD:** The least common multiple of the denominators (5, 4, 5, 5, 2) is **20**.

**Step 1: Multiply every term by the LCD, 20.**
$$20(-x) + 20\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) = 20\left(\frac{-21}{4}\right) + 20\left(\frac{14x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - 20\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$

**Step 2: Cancel denominators and multiply the remainders.**
* $20(-x) = \mathbf{-20x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(x) = \mathbf{4x}$
* $20/4 = 5 \implies 5(-21) = \mathbf{-105}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(14x) = \mathbf{56x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(3) = \mathbf{12}$
* $20/2 = 10 \implies -10(x) = \mathbf{-10x}$

**Intermediate Result (No Fractions):**
$$-20x + 4x = -105 + 56x + 12 - 10x$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms on each side.**
* **Left Side (x-terms):** $-20x + 4x = \mathbf{-16x}$
* **Right Side (x-terms):** $56x - 10x = \mathbf{46x}$
* **Right Side (Constants):** $-105 + 12 = \mathbf{-93}$

**Final Equation Ready to Solve:**
$$-16x = 46x - 93$$
**Step 1: Isolate x-terms by subtracting 46x from both sides.** $$-16x - 46x = -93$$ $$-62x = -93$$ **Step 2: Solve for x by dividing both sides by -62.** $$x = \frac{-93}{-62}$$ **Step 3: Simplify the fraction.** Both 93 and 62 are divisible by 31 (since $93 = 3 \times 31$ and $62 = 2 \times 31$). The negative signs cancel. $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$ $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$ **Check for Excluded Values:** The original denominators were 5, 4, 5, 5, and 2. Since none of the original denominators contained the variable $x$, there are **no excluded values ($\emptyset$)**. Therefore, the solution is valid. **Final Solution:** $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$
### Problem 1) Solving the Equation WITHOUT a Full LCD Strategy = Same Result, more steps, harder

**Original Equation:**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

***

**Step 1: Simplify the Left Side (Common Denominator is 5).**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-5x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} = \mathbf{\frac{-4x}{5}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify Constants on the Right Side (Common Denominator is 5 for the two constant fractions).**
$$\frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \left( \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} \right)$$
*Combine constants with common denominator 20:*
$$\frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{-21 \cdot 5}{20} + \frac{3 \cdot 4}{20} = \frac{-105 + 12}{20} = \mathbf{\frac{-93}{20}}$$

**New Equation:**
$$\frac{-4x}{5} = \frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 3: Move all x-terms to the Left Side.**

$$\frac{-4x}{5} - \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

**Step 4: Combine the first two x-terms (Common Denominator 5).**
$$\frac{-4x - 14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-18x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 5: Combine the remaining x-terms (Common Denominator is 10).**
$$\frac{-18x \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 2} + \frac{x \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-36x}{10} + \frac{5x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-31x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 6: Solve for x.**

1.  **Cross-Multiply (Allowed because it's Fraction = Fraction):**
    $$-31x \cdot 20 = -93 \cdot 10$$
    $$-620x = -930$$

2.  **Divide both sides by -620:**
    $$x = \frac{-930}{-620}$$
    $$x = \frac{93}{62}$$

3.  **Simplify (Divide by 31):**
    $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$

**Final Solution:**
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 1: Linear Equations - Clearing Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Multiply the entire equation by 100 (LCD of 1, 10, 100).**
$$100(-1.8x - 2.06x) = 100(-2.9x + 2.4)$$

**Resulting Integer Equation:**
$$-180x - 206x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 2: Combine Like Terms.**
$$-386x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 3: Isolate x-terms (Add 290x to both sides).**
$$-386x + 290x = 240$$
$$-96x = 240$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -96).**
$$x = \frac{240}{-96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify (Divide numerator and denominator by 48).**
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 2: Linear Equations - Solving with Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Combine Like Terms on the Left Side.**
$$(-1.8 - 2.06)x = -3.86x$$
$$-3.86x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 2: Isolate x-terms (Add 2.9x to both sides).**
$$-3.86x + 2.9x = 2.4$$

**Step 3: Combine x-terms.**
$$(-3.86 + 2.9)x = -0.96x$$
$$-0.96x = 2.4$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -0.96).**
$$x = \frac{2.4}{-0.96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify to Fraction/Decimal.**
*(To simplify the calculation, temporarily multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: $\frac{240}{-96}$)*
$$x = -\frac{240}{96}$$
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 5 - Converting a Repeating Decimal into a Fraction - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h30m20s
- **Repeating Decimal** = A decimal that repeats the same digit or pattern of digits forever.
- Examples of Repeating Decimals :

|    Fraction     |     Decimal Representation     | Read As                                                |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|  $\frac{1}{3}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{3}}$      | Zero point three repeating                             |
|  $\frac{1}{6}$  |     $0.1\mathbf{\bar{6}}$      | Zero point one six repeating                           |
|  $\frac{1}{9}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{1}}$      | Zero point one repeating                               |
| $\frac{2}{11}$  |   $0.\mathbf{\overline{18}}$   | Zero point one eight repeating                         |
| $\frac{5}{12}$  |     $0.41\mathbf{\bar{6}}$     | Zero point four one six repeating                      |
|  $\frac{1}{7}$  | $0.\mathbf{\overline{142857}}$ | Zero point one four two eight five seven repeating     |
| $\frac{44}{45}$ |   $0.9\mathbf{\overline{7}}$   | Zero point nine seven, repeating infinitely, of course |
- 44/45 = 0.97 repeating = he does a bunch of things where he multiplies the equation by 10, get's 8.8, then subtract x, then multiply by 10(again), then divide by 90.... bro, just round up or down, this is tedious just watching, I'm not typing all that out
- $10^n$ where $^n$ is the number of digits in the repeating string (so if 2 digits repeat infinitely, then do 2, etc)
## Algebra II - Lesson 6 - Solving for a Specified Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h48m45s
- d = rt (distance = rate * time)
- r = d/t (rate of speed = distance / time)
- t = d/r (time = distance / rate)
- You can manipulate your formulas to get what you need out of it
- p = 2l + 2w (perimeter of a rectangle = 2 Length + 2 Width)
-  p = 40 feet, w = 7 feet, you can now solve the equation to find the missing variable
- f = 9/5c + 32 (fahrenheit = 9/5 celsius + 32)
- multiply a fraction by its reciprocal to cancel it out 9/5c * 5/9c, what you do on one side do on the other
- 5/9(f-32) = c
## Algebra II - Lesson 7 - Applications of Linear Equations I - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h9m10s
- how to decode word problems so they make sense, and you can turn them into an equation to use :
- **Common Addition Phrases** = 'The Sum Of', 'More Than', 'Plus', 'Added to', 'Increased by', 
- **Phrases for Subtraction** = 'Less than', 'Less', 'Decreased by', 'Minus', 'Subtracted From'
- **Phrases for Multiplication** = 'Times', 'Multiplied by', 'Of'(fractions), 'Product of'
- **Phrases for Division** = 'Quotient of', 'Divided by', 
- **Is Means Equals** = Is = Equals
- **Commutative** = placement doesn't matter, addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and division are not (the order matters where you put the '-' or '/' sign on the terms), so take your time when you are reading so you know where to place the symbols correctly, how many times have I gotten something wrong because I left out a '-' or forgot to simplify
## Algebra II - Lesson 8 - Applications of Linear Equations II - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h30m
- There are generally only 3 types of word problems you will run into during Algebra I / II
- 6 Step Process to Solving a word problem :
1) Read the problem and determine the question(s) to be answered
2) Assign a variable to represent the unknown, sometimes more than one unknown
3) Write an equation
4) Solve an equation
5) Write the answer in terms of the question(s) asked 
6) Check the answer using the words of the problem
- Problem 1) Marci and Steven are siblings. Marci is four years older than Steven. If their combined age is 34, how old is Marci? How old is Steven? 
  **'S' = Stevens Age, 
  'M' = Marcis Age(S +4).**  
  $S + (S+4) = 34$ 
  $2S + 4 = 34$
  $2S = 30$
  $S = 15$
  Steven is 15 years old, while Marci is 19 years old. 
  Doing it starting with Marcis age :
  M = S + S - 4 = 34 
  2S = 38
  M = 19
  M - 4 = S
  S = 15
- Problem 2) During the **16-game** 2012 NFL regular season, **the Broncos, Chargers, and Raiders combined to win a total of 24 games.** The Chargers won 3 more games than the Raiders but won 6 fewer games than the Broncos. Find the regular season win/loss record for each team. 
  **X =  Number of games won by the chargers**
  **X - 3 = Number of games won by the raiders**
  **X+6 = Number of games won by the broncos**
  $X + X -3 + X + 6 = 24$
  3X + 3 = 24
  3X = 21
  X = 7 
  There are 7 games won by the chargers and lost 9 games, 4 games won by the raiders and lost 12, and 13 games won by the broncos and lost 3. 
- Problem 3)  Mark's retail clothing store currently has an inventory level of $585,000. This was an increase of 150% from one year ago. How much was the value of the inventory one year ago?
  **X = The value of inventory one year ago**
  X + 1.5X = 585,000$
  2.5X = 585,000$
  X = 234,000$
  The value of the inventory one year ago was 234,000$
- Problem 4) (added to anki) Gene invested $2000 for 3 years and earned a total of $300 in simple interest. What was his interest rate?
  **I = prt**, I = interest, p = principal, r = rate, t = time
  I / pt = r 
  300 / (2000)(3) = r
  r = 0.05 
  The interest rate was 5%.
## Algebra II - Lesson 9 - Applications of Linear Equations III - 17October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h53m36s
- Problem 1) (added to anki) An alcohol solution was made by mixing **3 gallons of an 80% alcohol solution** and **4 gallons of a 52% alcohol solution**. Find the concentratiowf the new mixture. 
   $\frac{Pure amount of the substance}{Total amount of the mixture} = concentration of the substance$ Pure amount of the substance / Total amount of the mixture = concentration of the substance (mathjax formattingiswierd)
   3 Gallons of 80% = 3 * 0.8 = 2.4 gallons
   4 gallons of 52% = 4 * 0.52 = 2.08 gallons
   $\frac{2.4 + 2.08}{3 + 4}$ = 0.64 = 64%
   The new mixture is 64% alcohol
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
### Problem 2) Mixture Problem: Solving for Fruit Punch Gallons
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?

**Goal:** Create 12 gallons of 48% fruit juice.
**Mixtures:** Betty's (38% juice) and Calvin's (53% juice).

---

#### 1. Define Variables

Let $B$ be the number of gallons of **Betty's** juice (38%).
Let $C$ be the number of gallons of **Calvin's** juice (53%).

---

#### 2. Set Up the System of Equations

We need two equations: one for the **Total Volume** and one for the **Total Amount of Pure Juice**.

**Equation 1: Total Volume (Gallons)**
The gallons of Betty's plus the gallons of Calvin's must equal the final 12 gallons.
$$B + C = 12$$

**Equation 2: Total Pure Juice (Juice Content)**
The amount of pure juice from Betty's ($0.38B$) plus the amount of pure juice from Calvin's ($0.53C$) must equal the amount of pure juice in the final mixture ($48\%$ of 12 gallons).
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 0.48(12)$$
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 5.76$$

---

#### 3. Solve the System (Using Substitution)

It's easiest to solve Equation 1 for $B$ and substitute it into Equation 2.

**A. Isolate B (from Eq 1):**
$$B = 12 - C$$

**B. Substitute (12 - C) into Eq 2:**
$$0.38(12 - C) + 0.53C = 5.76$$

**C. Distribute and Simplify:**
$$4.56 - 0.38C + 0.53C = 5.76$$
$$4.56 + 0.15C = 5.76$$

**D. Isolate C (Subtract 4.56 from both sides):**
$$0.15C = 5.76 - 4.56$$
$$0.15C = 1.20$$

**E. Solve for C (Divide by 0.15):**
$$C = \frac{1.20}{0.15}$$
$$\mathbf{C = 8 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 4. Find B (Substitute C=8 back into B = 12 - C)

$$B = 12 - 8$$
$$\mathbf{B = 4 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 5. Final Answer

**Betty's Juice (38%):** 4 gallons
**Calvin's Juice (53%):** 8 gallons

### Problem 3) Word Problem: Multi-Constraint System (Bill Totals)
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?

**Problem Equation:** $$100H + 20T + 1O = 1105$$

**Constraints (in terms of x=T):**
* $T = x$
* $H = T/6 \implies H = x/6$
* $O = T - 25 \implies O = x - 25$

---

#### 1. Formulate the Equation

Substitute all variables into the value equation:
$$100\left(\frac{x}{6}\right) + 20x + (x - 25) = 1105$$

#### 2. Simplify and Solve

**A. Simplify Coefficients:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 20x + x - 25 = 1105$$

**B. Combine $x$ terms and move constant:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 21x = 1105 + 25$$
$$\frac{50x}{3} + \frac{63x}{3} = 1130$$

**C. Combine fractions:**
$$\frac{113x}{3} = 1130$$

**D. Solve for x:**
$$113x = 3390$$
$$x = \frac{3390}{113}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 30}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

* $T = x = 30$ (Twenties)
* $H = x/6 = 30/6 = 5$ (Hundreds)
* $O = x - 25 = 30 - 25 = 5$ (Ones)
### Problem 4) Word Problem: Uniform Motion (Catch-Up Time)
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
**Goal:** Find the average rate of speed ($P$) of the passenger plane.

**Key Principle:** The distance traveled by both planes is equal ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$).

---

#### 1. Determine Time and Rate Variables

| Plane | Rate (R) | Time (T) | Distance (D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passenger (P)** | $P$ | $7 \text{ hrs} + 2 \text{ hrs} = 9$ | $9P$ |
| **Cargo (C)** | $P + 80$ | $7$ hrs | $7(P + 80)$ |

---

#### 2. Set Up the Equation ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$)

$$9P = 7(P + 80)$$

#### 3. Solve for P

**A. Distribute:**
$$9P = 7P + 560$$

**B. Isolate the variable:** Subtract $7P$ from both sides.
$$9P - 7P = 560$$
$$2P = 560$$

**C. Final Division:**
$$P = \frac{560}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{P = 280}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

The passenger plane's average rate of speed was **280 mph**.

## Algebra II - Lesson 10 - Interval Notation - 17October2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=12361s
- **Interval Notation** = Allows us to notate a specific range of numbers on a number line
- **Set Builder Notation** = { x | x has a certain property } syntax
- {x | -2 < x < 5 } = The set of all elements in set X  such that x is greater than -2 and less than 5
- {x | x = 7 } = Set builder notation for saying 'the set of all elements x | such that x = 7'
- x > 7 = you can use an open circle on a number line or a parnthesis '(' and shade on the number line to indicate that it continues
- X >= 5 = x greater than equal to 5 = use a filled in circle or a '[' bracket and shade after to show the solution region
- x < 3 = use an open circle or a parenthesis ')' and shade before 
- x <= -4 = x is less than equal to negative 4 = filled in circle or bracket ']' and shade everything to the left
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- $(-\infty, 5]$  Negative infinity, less than equal to 5, note that infinity needs a negative sign and a parenthesis
## Algebra II - Lesson 11 - Linear Inequalities in One Variable - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=13687s
- $ax+b<c$ : a, b, and c are real numbers. a is not allowed to be 0. 
- The main difference between an equation('=') and inequalitie is the greater/less than symbol
- Same as always, you are trying to find 'x', isolate the value by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing
- **The Multiplication Property of Inequality** = If you multiply both sides by any non-zero positive number, it won't effect the final solution. *If you multiply both sides by a negative number, YOU MUST FLIP THE DIRECTION OF THE INEQUALITY SYMBOL* : Also when you are *dividing by a negative, you need to flip the signs as well*
- big number not always bigger says grug, -2 > -5,  -5 is still the smaller number
- **Interval Notation** = (smallest value, largest value), so if x <= 6 = $(-\infty, 6]$, the ']' bracket indicates that six is part of the solution, always use a parenthesis with infinity
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- To check your inequality : Change the inequality to '=' and check if 'x' is = to a true statement, establish solution and non solution regions/boundaries, then check one on each side, tedious
- Graphing : same as above, this video is largely just review, open circle excluded, fully filled circle for included or use parenthesis/brackets, and shade the solution area
- **Three Part Inequality** = '8 < 8 -5a < 38' : '8 -5a' is greater than 8, and less than 38, both conditions need to be met, 2 options : seperate and solve and put back together, or solve and do same thing to each part by isolating 'a' in middle and do everything to both sides : subtract '8' from both sides and divide both sides by '-5' to isolate, since you are dividing by a negative, the equality signs must flip : '0 > a > -6', but you need to rearrange, so, flip the symbols again, '-6 < a < 0' = 'a' is greater than negative six and less than 0 : or (-6, 0) for interval notation
## Algebra II - Lesson 12 - Compound Inequalities - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=4h19m
- **Compound Inequality** = A compound inequality consists of two inequalities linked by **And** or **Or**
- **And** inequality how to solve steps : 1) Solve each inequality seperately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *both inequalities* - if you don't get a solution that can satisfy BOTH inequalities / overlap - then you have NO SOLUTION
- **Or** inequalities and how to solve steps : 1) solve each inequality separately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *either inequality* - if you have an element that is common to both, list it only once. The *union* of the two sets.
### Compound Inequalities

**Definition:** Two or more inequalities joined by the words **AND** or **OR**.

| Type | Definition | Solution Set |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AND** | The variable must satisfy **BOTH** inequalities. (Intersection) | The overlapping region on the number line. |
| **OR** | The variable must satisfy **AT LEAST ONE** of the inequalities. (Union) | All regions covered by either inequality. |

---

#### Case 1: "AND" Compound Inequality (Intersection)

**Problem:** Solve $-5 < 2x + 1 \le 11$

**Step 1: Isolate the variable ($x$) in the middle.**
* Subtract 1 from all three parts:
    $$-5 - 1 < 2x + 1 - 1 \le 11 - 1$$
    $$-6 < 2x \le 10$$

**Step 2: Solve for $x$.**
* Divide all three parts by 2:
    $$\frac{-6}{2} < \frac{2x}{2} \le \frac{10}{2}$$
    $$\mathbf{-3 < x \le 5}$$

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Overlap):**
* Since $x$ must be greater than $-3$ AND less than or equal to $5$, the solution is a single interval.
    $$\mathbf{(-3, 5]}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid -3 < x \le 5\}}$$

---

#### Case 2: "OR" Compound Inequality (Union)

**Problem:** Solve $3x + 4 \le 10$ **OR** $x - 7 > 2$

**Step 1: Solve each inequality separately.**

| Left Inequality (OR) | Right Inequality (OR) |
| :--- | :--- |
| $3x + 4 \le 10$ | $x - 7 > 2$ |
| $3x \le 6$ | $x > 9$ |
| $\mathbf{x \le 2}$ | $\mathbf{x > 9}$ |

**Step 2: Combine the solutions using "OR".**
* The solution includes all values $\le 2$ *plus* all values $> 9$.

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Combined Regions):**
* Use the **Union** symbol ($\cup$) to join the two separate intervals.
    $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 2] \cup (9, \infty)}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \le 2 \text{ or } x > 9\}}$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=5h30m40s
- Where? How? **Absolute Value** means the distance away from '0' so you need a positive and negative. 
- For absolute value inequalities, you will need a negative AND a positive for each one - **The sign will also be flipped when doing the opposite values** 
- *When dividing or multiplying by a negative, don't forget to FLIP the sign*
- For > greater than you need to use an 'OR' with a compound inequality, for < less than you need to use an 'AND' to get the correct solution sets, formulas/syntax below :
- |x| > k : x > k OR x < -k
- |x| < k : x < k AND x > -k
- Make sure you ISOLATE the absolute value operation as much as you can before making your inequality statements, aka clear everything OUTSIDE of the '| |' absolutes must be worked into the inequality, for example : '7|10k + 3| + 7 < 28' should be worked down to : '|10k +3| < 3' BEFORE doing your 'AND' or 'OR' statements
- Problem 1) (added to anki)
   |x| $\ge$ 2 : So you will need both a negative and positive for these as well, so $(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)$ is the solution set (any number that is less than $\le$ -2 Union with any number that is  $\ge$ greater than equal to 2)

## Algebra II - Lesson 15 - Linear Equations in Two Variables - 20October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h3m10s
- Linear equations with only one variable generally only have one answer (find x, oh look, there it is) - with 2 variables, there is no longer one solution, there is an infinite number of solutions
- **Standard Form of a Linear Equation** : **ax + by = c** A linear equation in two variables is of the form : **ax + by = c** , 'a' 'b' and 'c' are real numbers, 'a' and 'b' can not be '0' zero at the same time
- If there are exponents (besides ^1), then it is not a linear equation. For example :  $ax^2 + by^2 = c$ is not a linear equation
- **Ordered Pair** = A solution to a linear equation in two variables is called an ordered pair : **(x, y)** - *'X' is always first, 'Y' is always second*
- To solve a linear equation with 2 variables, plug in a number for one of the variables, and solve for the other one. - Pick something for 'X', solve for 'Y'. Pick something for 'Y', solve for 'X'
- **Table of Values** : Many ordered pairs, used for graphing, if a value for 'x' is -, you get - for 'Y'  
### Table of Values for $4x - 3y = -12$

| $x$ | $y$ | Calculation |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **0** | **4** | $4(0) - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -12 \implies y = 4$ |
| **-3** | **0** | $4x - 3(0) = -12 \implies 4x = -12 \implies x = -3$ |
| **3** | **8** | $4(3) - 3y = -12 \implies 12 - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -24 \implies y = 8$ |

**Completed Points:** $(0, 4)$, $(-3, 0)$, and $(3, 8)$.

### Table of Values for $-x + 7y = 28$

|  $x$   |  $y$  | Calculation                                                            |
| :----: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7**  | **5** | $-7 + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 35 \implies y = 5$                         |
| **-7** | **3** | $-x + 7(3) = 28 \implies -x + 21 = 28 \implies -x = 7 \implies x = -7$ |
| **0**  | **4** | $-(0) + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 28 \implies y = 4$                       |
**Completed Points:** $(7, 5)$, $(-7, 3)$, and $(0, 4)$.

- What do you with your ordered pairs? You plot them on your **coordinate plane** aka graphing
- **Cartesian Coordinate System** = sum ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum. A fancy way to say graph
- **Rectangular Coordinate System** = yet another name for a graph
- **Origin** = **(0, 0)** 
- **X-Axis** = Goes left to right, Horizontal
- **Y-Axis** = Goes up and down, Vertical
- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)

- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)
- After plotting your ordered pairs, you should get a line, draw a line through it, with arrows to indicate that it keeps going, commonly you would label the line with the equation
- **X Intercept** = Where your graph crosses the X-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'x' and solve for 'y'
- **Y-Intercept** = Where your graph cross the Y-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'y' and solve for 'x'
- **The Intercept Method** = '0' is easy to work with, so just find the 'x intercept' and 'y intercept' - you can graph it with just 2 points, but you want one arbitrary point as a check, you want to end up with integers, not decimals or fractions
- **ax + by +c(0)** We often see equations whose 'x' and 'y' intercepts occurs at the origin (0,0), this will always have a 'c'= 0 zero
- **y = k**  = Graphing horizontal lines will have an equation like this - Y will always be the same, no matter what (it's flat, horizontal straight line, forever), no matter what you plug in for 'x' it will always be the same 'y'
- **x = k** = Graphing a vertical line will have an equation like this, since 'y = 0', x will always have the same value, and be vertical
### Graphing $-x + 4y = -4$ using the Intercept Method

**Equation:** $-x + 4y = -4$

---

#### 1. Find the x-intercept (Set $y = 0$)

* Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-x + 4(0) = -4$$
    $$-x = -4$$
    $$x = 4$$
* **x-intercept point:** **$(4, 0)$**

---

#### 2. Find the y-intercept (Set $x = 0$)

* Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-(0) + 4y = -4$$
    $$4y = -4$$
    $$y = -1$$
* **y-intercept point:** **$(0, -1)$**

---

#### 3. Plotting Points and Check Point

* **Plot these two intercepts:** $(4, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.
* Draw a straight line connecting them.

* **Check Point:** $(8, 1)$
    * Substitute $x = 8$ and $y = 1$ into the original equation:
        $$-(8) + 4(1) = -4$$
        $$-8 + 4 = -4$$
        $$-4 = -4 \quad \checkmark$$
    * Since $-4 = -4$, the point $(8, 1)$ **is on the line**. This confirms our line is drawn correctly.

## Algebra II - Lesson 17 - The Slope of a Line - 21October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h54m
- **Slope** = $\frac{Rise}{Run}$ = The ratio of vertical change (Rise) to horizontal change (Run) 
- **Slope Formula from 2 points** = $m = \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$ = 'm' stands for slope, $x1 -x2 \neq 0$, You can not divide by 0, so make sure the 2 points you pick don't equal 0 when subtracted
- **Subscript** = $y2$ = y sub 2 = the number after the variable is called a subscript - the order you place the subscripts on the ordered pairs (x, y) doesn't matter, you will get the same result regardless, just be consistent
- $m = -\frac{5}{8}$ if the slope is negative, you can swap it, if the rise goes down 5, the run is eight, if the rise goes up 5, the run goes back 8 - a negative value on y = you are going down, a negative value on the x means it goes to the left
- y = 3 : The slope of any horizontal line is always zero - no matter what you choose for 'x', 'y' is always 3
- x = -4 : The slope of a vertical line is 'undefined' (since you are dividing by 0)
- $+\frac{3}{5}$ = A positively sloped line rises as we move to the right (x+, y+)
- $+\frac{3}{2}$a negatively sloped line goes down as we move to the right (x+, y-)
- $y = mx + b$ = slope intercept form, 'm' is the slope, 'b' is the y intercept - so just solve the equation for 'y' and the coefficient of 'x' is the slope
### Slope Calculation : (-13,2) (19,-18)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-13, 2) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -13, y_1 = 2$$
$$P_2 = (19, -18) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 19, y_2 = -18$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{-18 - 2}{19 - (-13)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{-20}{19 + 13}$$
$$m = \frac{-20}{32}$$

**Step 3: Reduce the fraction.**
*Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF (4):*
$$m = \frac{-20 \div 4}{32 \div 4}$$
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{5}{8}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{5}{8}$$
### Slope Calculation (15, -10) (10, 6)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (15, -10) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = 15, y_1 = -10$$
$$P_2 = (10, 6) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 10, y_2 = 6$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{6 - (-10)}{10 - 15}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{6 + 10}{-5}$$
$$m = \frac{16}{-5}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{16}{5}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{16}{5}$$
### Slope Calculation (-7, -9) (-14, 12)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-7, -9) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -7, y_1 = -9$$
$$P_2 = (-14, 12) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = -14, y_2 = 12$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{12 - (-9)}{-14 - (-7)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{12 + 9}{-14 + 7}$$
$$m = \frac{21}{-7}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -3}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -3$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (x-y = 28)

**Equation:**
$$x - y = 28$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract x from both sides:*
$$-y = -x + 28$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-x + 28)$$
$$y = x - 28$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$y = \mathbf{1}x - 28$$
$$\mathbf{m = 1}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 1$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (6x - y = 8)

**Equation:**
$$6x - y = -8$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $6x$ from both sides:*
$$-y = -6x - 8$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-6x - 8)$$
$$y = 6x + 8$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = 6}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 6$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=7h23m15s
- **y = mx + b** : The quickest way to get the slope is to solve for 'y' aka 'slop intercept form'
- Slope intercept form is also the fastest way to graph a linear equation with 2 variables
- **Perpendicular Lines** =  2 perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1, they will intersect at a 90 degree angle $$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$
- **Parralel Lines** = 2 non vertical lines that have the same slope are parallel ( if 2 lines have the same slope, but a different y-intercept, they are parallel)
### Perpendicular Lines Rule

**Rule:** Two non-vertical lines are perpendicular if and only if their slopes ($m_1$ and $m_2$) are **opposite reciprocals**.

**Formula (Condition for Perpendicularity):**
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$

**Alternatively:** The product of their slopes must equal $-1$.
$$\mathbf{m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1}$$

**Steps to Find the Perpendicular Slope:**
1.  **Flip** the original slope (find the reciprocal).
2.  **Change the sign** (find the opposite).

**Example:**
* If $m_1 = \frac{4}{5}$, then $m_2 = -\frac{5}{4}$.
* If $m_1 = -3$, then $m_2 = \frac{1}{3}$.
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (5x - 4y = 12)

**Equation:**
$$5x - 4y = -12$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $5x$ from both sides:*
$$-4y = -5x - 12$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Divide every term on both sides by -4:*
$$\frac{-4y}{-4} = \frac{-5x}{-4} - \frac{12}{-4}$$
$$y = \frac{5}{4}x + 3$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = \frac{5}{4}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = \frac{5}{4}$$
### Solving Linear Equations (x+3y =12) (4x-3y = 3)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$, meaning their slopes are opposite reciprocals.

**Equations:**
1.  $$x + 3y = 12$$
2.  $$4x - 3y = 3$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$x + 3y = 12$$
$$3y = -x + 12$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 4$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$4x - 3y = 3$$
$$-3y = -4x + 3$$
$$y = \frac{-4x}{-3} + \frac{3}{-3}$$
$$y = \frac{4}{3}x - 1$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{3}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{3}$.*

* Are they **opposite reciprocals**?
    * The reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $-3$.
    * The opposite reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $\mathbf{+3}$.
* **Since $\frac{4}{3} \neq 3$**, the lines are **NOT** perpendicular.

---

**Conclusion:**
The slopes are $\mathbf{-\frac{1}{3}}$ and $\mathbf{\frac{4}{3}}$. Since their product is $\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = -\frac{4}{9} \neq -1$, the lines are **NOT perpendicular or parallel**.
### Solving Perpendicular Linear Equations (7x + 4y = 8) (-4x + 7y = -21)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$.

**Equations:**
1.  $$7x + 4y = 8$$
2.  $$-4x + 7y = -21$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$7x + 4y = 8$$
$$4y = -7x + 8$$
$$y = \frac{-7}{4}x + 2$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$-4x + 7y = -21$$
$$7y = 4x - 21$$
$$y = \frac{4}{7}x - 3$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{7}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{7}$.*

* **Opposite Reciprocal Check:**
    * The reciprocal of $\frac{7}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{7}$.
    * The opposite sign of a negative slope is positive.
    * The slopes are indeed opposite reciprocals.

* **Product Check:**
    $$m_1 \cdot m_2 = \left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{7}\right) = \mathbf{-1 \quad (\checkmark)}$$

---

**Conclusion:**
Since $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, the lines are **perpendicular**.

- **Slope-Intercept Form** = **y = mx + b** m = slope (coefficient of 'x) + b(y intercept)
- **Point - Slope Form** = $\mathbf{y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)}$ : Use this when you know the slope and a single point on the line, or you have 2 points, solve for 'y' and get slope intercept form
- **Standard Form** = $ax + by = c$ : write a and b like that, and 'a' or 'b' can not by '0' for standard form, strict definition 'a' 'b' and 'c' are integers (no fractions/decimals) 'a' 'b' 'c' can have no common factor except 1
### Point-Slope Form Formula

---

**Term Definitions:**

| Term | Meaning | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **$y$ and $x$** | **Variables** | Represent any point $(x, y)$ that lies on the line. They are the variables that remain in the final equation. |
| **$m$** | **Slope** | The steepness or rate of change of the line. It is calculated as "rise over run" ($\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$). |
| **$y_1$ and $x_1$** | **Specific Point** | The known, single ordered pair $(\mathbf{x_1}, \mathbf{y_1})$ that the line passes through. |

**Purpose:** This form is used when you know the **slope ($m$)** and one **point $(x_1, y_1)$** of a line. It is often the first step before converting the equation to the final slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$).

$$y - 3 = \left(\frac{2}{3} \cdot x\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right)$$
$$y - 3 = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$$

#### 3. Isolate $y$ (Slope-Intercept Form)

*Add 3 to both sides:*
$$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2 + 3$$

$$y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 2$$

#### 2. Eliminate the Fraction

*To remove the denominator of 2, multiply every term by **2**.*
$$2 \cdot y = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{2}x\right) - 2 \cdot 2$$
$$2y = -3x - 4$$

* Parallel to: $\mathbf{y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3}$

**Goal:** Find the equation of the new line in Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$).

---

#### 1. Determine the Slope of the New Line

* **Rule for Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the **same slope**.
* The given line $y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3$ is in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), so its slope is $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.
* Therefore, the slope of our new line is also $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.

---

#### 2. Use Point-Slope Form

* Use the slope $m = -\frac{7}{5}$ and the given point $(x_1, y_1) = (-5, 3)$.
* **Point-Slope Formula:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x - (-5))$$
    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x + 5)$$

---

#### 3. Convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

**A. Distribute the slope:**
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot 5\right)$$
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - 7$$

**B. Eliminate the fraction:**
* Multiply every term by **5** to clear the denominator.
    $$5(y) - 5(3) = 5\left(-\frac{7}{5}x\right) - 5(7)$$
    $$5y - 15 = -7x - 35$$

**C. Rearrange to $Ax + By = C$ (ensure A is positive):**
* Move the $x$-term ($-7x$) to the left side by adding $7x$ to both sides.
* Move the constant term ($-15$) to the right side by adding $15$ to both sides.
    $$7x + 5y - 15 = -35$$
    $$7x + 5y = -35 + 15$$
    $$\mathbf{7x + 5y = -20}$$

---

**Goal:** Find the equation of a line perpendicular to $y = 2x - 1$ and passing through $(2, -3)$, then convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$).

---

#### 1. Determine the Slope of the New Line ($m$)

* **Given Line Slope ($m_{\text{given}}$):** The slope of $y = 2x - 1$ is $\mathbf{m_{\text{given}} = 2}$.
* **Rule for Perpendicular Lines:** The slope of the new line ($m$) must be the **opposite reciprocal** of $m_{\text{given}}$.
    $$\mathbf{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

---

#### 2. Use Point-Slope Form

* Use the perpendicular slope $m = -\frac{1}{2}$ and the given point $(x_1, y_1) = (2, -3)$.
* **Point-Slope Formula:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

    $$y - (-3) = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 2)$$
    $$y + 3 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 2)$$

---

#### 3. Convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

**A. Eliminate the fraction:**
* Multiply every term by **2** to clear the denominator.
    $$2(y) + 2(3) = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(x - 2)$$
    $$2y + 6 = -1(x - 2)$$
    $$2y + 6 = -x + 2$$

**B. Rearrange to $Ax + By = C$ (ensure A is positive):**
* Move the $x$-term ($-x$) to the left side by adding $x$.
* Move the constant term ($6$) to the right side by subtracting $6$.
    $$x + 2y = 2 - 6$$
    $$\mathbf{x + 2y = -4}$$

---

**Final Equation in Standard Form:**
$$\mathbf{x + 2y = -4}$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=8h16m50s
- $ax + by < c$ : **Standard Form** this is a linear inequality, same as linear equalities just a different sign - 'a' 'b' and 'c' are real numbers, 'a' and 'b' are not BOTH zero 
- **Solution Region** = Any orderered pair (x, y) that satisfies the inequality
- **Non-Solution Region** = Any orderered pair (x, y) that do not satisfy the inequality
- **Boundary Line** = A line that seperates the solution region from the non-solution region
- **Strict Inequality** : '<' or '>' means that the boundary line is NOT part of the solution = **Dashed Line**
- **Non-Strict Inequality** : '$\ge$' or '$\le$' means that the boundary line IS part of the solution = **Solid Line**
- **Graphing a Linear Inequality in Two Variables** = Siimply Replace the inequality symbol with an equality symbol, then graph the resulting line (**Boundary Line**)
- 2 Ways to Solve/Graph :
	1) Test Point : (0,0) if the inequality holds true, shade everything in that region, if false, shade everything on the other side of the line : 2x + y < 3 : 0x + 0y < 3 : 0 < 3 : True : Shade everything on the side of the line with the test point, that is the solution region
	2) Solving for 'Y' : **Point Slope Form** : y < -2x + 3 : if you have a '<' 'less than' symbol, shade below the line, a '>' 'greater than' symbol, shade above (faster than using a testpoint)
	 - Note : You can use the test point in either the **Standard Form** or **Point Slope Form** and if the test point is true, it's within the solution region, false is outside.
- Special Case (Horizontal Line) : Y > 1 : Since x will always be zero, you get a horizontal line
- Special Case (Vertical Line) : X $\ge$ -3 : since y will always be zero, you get a vertical line 
- For solving **Compound Inequalities** example : x + y < 3 AND -3x + y $\ge$ -1 (completed below) you are solving to look for the intersection of the 2 solution sets, looking for the section of the coordinate plane that is the overlap, that satisfies **BOTH** inequalities - **TO Solve** : Solve each for 'Y' using **Point Slope Form** Then Graph each, and then look for overlap
- '**AND**' and '**OR**' the difference between these 2 keywords means : **AND** The solution is **BOTH** the inequalities. **OR** means the solution satisfies just one of the solution sets 
### Solving Linear Inequality: $5x - 3y \ge 15$

**Goal:** Isolate $y$ to convert the inequality into a graphable form ($y \le mx + b$ or $y \ge mx + b$).

**Inequality:**
$$5x - 3y \ge 15$$

---

#### 1. Isolate the $y$ term

*Subtract $5x$ from both sides:*
$$-3y \ge -5x + 15$$

#### 2. Solve for $y$

*Divide every term by $\mathbf{-3}$.*

$$\text{**CRITICAL STEP:** When multiplying or dividing an inequality 
by a negative number, you MUST **flip the inequality sign** ($\ge$ becomes $\le$).}$$

$$\frac{-3y}{-3} \le \frac{-5x}{-3} + \frac{15}{-3}$$

$$y \le \frac{5}{3}x - 5$$

---

#### 3. Final Solution (Graphing Form)

The solution to the inequality is:
$$\mathbf{y \le \frac{5}{3}x - 5}$$

**Interpretation for Graphing:**
* **Boundary Line:** The boundary line is $y = \frac{5}{3}x - 5$.
    * Slope ($m$): $\frac{5}{3}$
    * Y-intercept ($b$): $-5$
* **Line Type:** The $\le$ symbol means the line should be **solid** (to include points on the line).
* **Shading:** The $y \le \dots$ means you shade the region **below** the boundary line.
### Solving System of Linear Inequalities (x + y < 3 AND -3x + y $\ge$ -1) 

**Goal:** Graph the two inequalities to find the common shaded region.

**Inequalities:**
1.  $$x + y < 3$$
2.  $$-3x + y \ge -1$$

---

#### 1. Convert Inequality 1 to Graphing Form ($y = mx + b$)

$$x + y < 3$$
*Subtract $x$ from both sides:*
$$\mathbf{y < -x + 3}$$

* **Boundary Line:** $y = -x + 3$
* **Line Type:** **Dashed** (due to $<$ )
* **Shading:** **Below** the line (due to $<$ )

---

#### 2. Convert Inequality 2 to Graphing Form ($y = mx + b$)

$$-3x + y \ge -1$$
*Add $3x$ to both sides:*
$$\mathbf{y \ge 3x - 1}$$

* **Boundary Line:** $y = 3x - 1$
* **Line Type:** **Solid** (due to $\ge$ )
* **Shading:** **Above** the line (due to $\ge$ )

---

#### 3. Find the Point of Intersection (The Corner of the Solution Region)

The solution region is bounded by the intersection of the two boundary lines:
$$y = -x + 3$$
$$y = 3x - 1$$

* **Set equations equal:**
    $$-x + 3 = 3x - 1$$
* **Solve for x:**
    $$4 = 4x$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 1}$$
* **Solve for y (Substitute $x=1$):**
    $$y = -(1) + 3$$
    $$\mathbf{y = 2}$$

The boundary lines intersect at the point **(1, 2)**.

---

#### Solution Summary

The solution is the region that is **BELOW the line $y = -x + 3$** AND **ABOVE or ON the line $y = 3x - 1$**, with the corner point being **(1, 2)**.

- **Relation** = A set of ordered pairs - it is useful in mathematics to describe one quantity with it's RELATION to another
- All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.
- {(0, 0), (1, 12), (12 ,24), .. (0, 450)} : What a set of ordered pairs looks like aka a Relation
- **x** is the input variable and **y** is the output variable, the value of 'y' is dependant on the value of 'x'
- **Dependant Variable** = Dependant on another input variable for it's value (output variable, 'Y')
- **Independant Variable** = Not dependant on another variable (input varaible, 'X')
- **Domain** = **First Components** = A set of allowed values/inputs for the independant variable 'x' 
- **Range** = **Second Components** = A set of allowable values for your dependant variable 'y'
- **Function** = A special type of relation. Each member of the domain must correspond to EXACTLY ONE member of the range - Each 'x' value must link up to exactly one 'y' value -  IF YOU HAVE DUPLICATE "**X**" VALUES, IT IS NOT A FUNCTION, a 'Y' value can be linked to two different x values, only 'X' can't be duped - Each 'X' value can only be linked up to ONE unique 'Y' value - Different 'X' values CAN correspond to the same 'Y' value 
## Algebra II - Lesson 22 - More on Functions - 27October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=9h16m20s
- **Function** = A special type of relation. Each member of the domain must correspond to EXACTLY ONE member of the range - Each 'x' value must link up to exactly one 'y' value -  IF YOU HAVE DUPLICATE "**X**" VALUES, IT IS NOT A FUNCTION, a 'Y' value can be linked to two different x values, only 'X' can't be duped - Each 'X' value can only be linked up to ONE unique 'Y' value - Different 'X' values CAN correspond to the same 'Y' value 
- $y = 2x + 7$ : Domain = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ Range = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ : You can look at an equation and see if it's a function using the...
- **Vertical Line Test** = If a vertical line on a graph touches more than 1 point, it is not a function (because 'x' can not have 2 of the same values for a given 'x' value)
- Notes on finding the domains/ranges : You can't divide by zero, you can't take the square root of a negative number and get a real number, when we square a number the result is non-negative
- $y =6$ : technically, this is a function, because every 'x' value has only one 'y' value
- $\text{All Real Numbers: } \quad \left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ : All real numbers that can be used for the domain can be represented with $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ 
- $y^2$ = x : This is not a function. 
- $\text{Domain= } \{x \mid x \ge 0\}$ or $[0, \infty)$. Range = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ : This is not a function (It's a unit circle) (Example below) 
- The $\mathbf{\text{plus or minus}}$ ($\pm$) rule is used when solving an equation by taking the square root of a squared variable, ensuring you account for both the **positive** and **negative** roots, as both values squared yield the same result. (Example below)
- $y = \frac{1}{x}$ : This is a function. (also an asymptote) (Example Below)
### Domain and Range for the Circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$

**Description:** This equation defines a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.

---

#### 1. Domain (Possible x-values)

The circle extends from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$.

| Notation | Formula |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{x \mid -1 \le x \le 1\}}$$ |
| **Interval** | $$\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$$ |

---

#### 2. Range (Possible y-values)

The circle extends from $y = -1$ to $y = 1$.

| Notation        | Formula                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{y \mid -1 \le y \le 1\}}$$ |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$$                   |
### 📝 The "Plus or Minus" Rule (Solving for $x^2$ or $y^2$)

**The Rule:** When solving an equation by taking the square root of a **squared variable** ($x^2$ or $y^2$), you must include the $\mathbf{\pm}$ sign on the opposite side of the equation.

**Example:**
If $$y^2 = 9$$
Then $$\sqrt{y^2} = \pm\sqrt{9}$$
$$\mathbf{y = \pm 3}$$

---

#### Why the $\pm$ is Necessary (The Two Solutions)

The $\pm$ sign reflects the fact that **two different numbers**, a positive one and a negative one, can be squared to yield the same positive result.

| Number | Squared Result |
| :---: | :---: |
| **3** | $(3)^2 = 9$ |
| **-3** | $(-3)^2 = 9$ |

Since the original equation ($y^2 = 9$) does not tell you whether $y$ was positive or negative before it was squared, you must account for **both possibilities** to capture all valid solutions. If you only wrote $y = 3$, you would lose the solution $y = -3$.

---

#### Key Distinction: Square Root Function vs. Solving an Equation

1.  **The Square Root Function ($\sqrt{x}$):**
    * The radical symbol ($\sqrt{ }$) *always* means the **principal (non-negative) square root**.
    * Example: $\sqrt{25}$ is only $\mathbf{5}$ (never $-5$).

2.  **Solving an Equation ($y^2 = 25$):**
    * You are performing an operation (taking the root) to **both sides** to find the unknown value $y$.
    * You are asking: "What number(s) squared equals 25?" The answer is **both** $5$ and $-5$. You introduce the $\pm$ to represent the two possible values of $y$.
### Domain and Range for the Reciprocal Function $y = \frac{1}{x}$ (Asymptote)

**Description:** This function creates a graph called a hyperbola, which has vertical and horizontal asymptotes at the axes.

---

#### 1. Domain (Possible x-values)

The domain is restricted because the denominator cannot be zero.

* **Restriction:** $x \neq 0$

| Notation        | Formula                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \neq 0\}}$$           |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)}$$ |

---

#### 2. Range (Possible y-values)

The range is restricted because the numerator (1) is never zero, so the fraction can never equal zero.

* **Restriction:** $y \neq 0$

| Notation        | Formula                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{y \mid y \neq 0\}}$$           |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)}$$ |

## Algebra II - Lesson 23 - Function Notation - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=9h49m45s
- $y = x + 3$ is a function
- $y = x^2 - 5$ is a function
- eventually you move on from the above two examples where 'y'(dependant) gets it's value from 'x'(strong, independant) to 'f(x)' which does the same thing as 'y = x + c'
- **f, g, h** = functions are generally named with these letters **f(x), g(x), h(x)**
- **f(x)** = means a *function* of *x*
- $y = x^4 -3x + 7$ is the same thing as $f(x) = x^4 -3x + 7$ 
- $f(2)$ = simply means what is the value when the function is 2, just plug 2 in for x and solve.
- $f(a)$ = you can also use variables, doesn't change anything, just changing letter :
  $f(x) = 3x -1$ : $f(a) = 3a -1$   
- $f(a + 2)$ = 3(a + 2) - 1  : 
  f(a + 2) = 3a + 6 -1 : 3a +5 
- Squaring a binomial means multiplying it by itself $(z -1)^2$ isn't $(z^2 - 1^2)$ It's $(z-1)(z-1)$
- **Explicit Form** = A function is in explicit form when it is solved for the dependant variable: $y = f(x) = 3x - 5$ 
- **Implicit Form** = When the function is not solved for the dependant variable, we say it's in implicit form : $-5 = -3x + y$ 
- **Implicit Differentation** = It means that the function is NOT solved for 'y' - just solve for 'y' to get it back to **Explicit Form** then solve for $f(x)$ after 
- *()* = Use Parenthesis when substituting values, it will stop you from making mistakes
### 📝 Function Evaluation: $f(z - 1)$

**Given Function:**
$$f(x) = -5x^2 - 3x - 7$$

**Goal:** Evaluate $f(z - 1)$.

---

#### 1. Substitute $(z - 1)$ for $x$

$$f(z - 1) = -5(z - 1)^2 - 3(z - 1) - 7$$

---

#### 2. Expand the Squared Term

*Use the formula for squaring a binomial: $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$*
$$(z - 1)^2 = z^2 - 2(z)(1) + 1^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1$$

*Substitute this back into the expression:*
$$f(z - 1) = -5(z^2 - 2z + 1) - 3(z - 1) - 7$$

---

#### 3. Distribute the Coefficients

*Distribute $-5$ into the first parentheses.*
*Distribute $-3$ into the second parentheses.*

$$f(z - 1) = (-5z^2 + 10z - 5) + (-3z + 3) - 7$$

---

#### 4. Combine Like Terms

*Group terms by the power of z:*

$$\text{z}^2 \text{ terms: } \quad -5z^2$$
$$\text{z terms: } \quad 10z - 3z = 7z$$
$$\text{Constant terms: } \quad -5 + 3 - 7 = -2 - 7 = -9$$

---

#### 5. Final Simplified Function

*Combine the simplified terms:*

$$\mathbf{f(z - 1) = -5z^2 + 7z - 9}$$
### 📝 Explanation: Where Does -2z Come From in $(z - 1)^2$?

The error in thinking is often that $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - b^2$, but that is **INCORRECT**.

#### 1. The Correct Way to Square a Binomial

Squaring a binomial means multiplying it by itself:
$$(z - 1)^2 \quad \text{is the same as} \quad (z - 1)(z - 1)$$

#### 2. Using the FOIL Method

You must multiply every term in the first parentheses by every term in the second:

$$\mathbf{F} (\text{First}): \quad z \cdot z = z^2$$
$$\mathbf{O} (\text{Outer}): \quad z \cdot (-1) = -z$$
$$\mathbf{I} (\text{Inner}): \quad -1 \cdot z = -z$$
$$\mathbf{L} (\text{Last}): \quad -1 \cdot (-1) = +1$$

#### 3. Combining Like Terms

When you add the four resulting terms together, you get:
$$z^2 \quad \underbrace{-z - z}_{\text{These are the z-terms!}} \quad + 1$$

$$\mathbf{(z - 1)^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1}$$

---

#### Where your specific term comes from:

In your full problem, you had $-5$ multiplied by this result:
$$-5(z^2 - 2z + 1)$$

When you distribute the $-5$:
$$-5 \cdot z^2 = -5z^2$$
$$-5 \cdot (-2z) = \mathbf{+10z}$$
$$-5 \cdot (+1) = -5$$

So, the $\mathbf{-2z}$ is the middle term generated when you expand $(z-1)^2$ before the $-5$ is distributed.
### 📝 Implicit Function Evaluation

**Given Implicit Equation:**
$$x^4 - x^2 + 2y = 10$$

**Goal:** Find $f(0)$, $f(-2)$, and $f(5)$.

---

#### 1. Convert to Explicit Function $f(x)$

*Isolate $y$ by subtracting $x^4$ and $-x^2$ from both sides:*
$$2y = 10 - x^4 + x^2$$

*Divide every term by 2:*
$$y = \frac{10}{2} - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2}$$

**Explicit Function ($f(x)$):**
$$\mathbf{f(x) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}x^4 + \frac{1}{2}x^2}$$

---

#### 2. Evaluate $f(0)$

*Substitute $x = 0$ into the function:*
$$f(0) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2$$
$$f(0) = 5 - 0 + 0$$
$$\mathbf{f(0) = 5}$$

---

#### 3. Evaluate $f(-2)$

*Substitute $x = -2$ into the function:*
$$f(-2) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(-2)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2$$
$$f(-2) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(16) + \frac{1}{2}(4)$$
$$f(-2) = 5 - 8 + 2$$
$$\mathbf{f(-2) = -1}$$

---

#### 4. Evaluate $f(5)$

*Substitute $x = 5$ into the function:*
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(5)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(5)^2$$
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(625) + \frac{1}{2}(25)$$
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{625}{2} + \frac{25}{2}$$

*Combine the fractions (common denominator of 2):*
$$f(5) = \frac{10}{2} - \frac{625}{2} + \frac{25}{2}$$
$$f(5) = \frac{10 - 625 + 25}{2}$$
$$f(5) = \frac{-590}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{f(5) = -295}$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 24 - Variation - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h13m
- **Direct Variation** : $y = kx$ : 'y' varies directly with(as) 'x' if there exists a real number 'k' such that $y = kx$ : to find 'k', simply divide 'y' by 'x'
- 'k' = ~~konstant~~ **Constant of Variation** = **Constant of Proportionality**(samething) =  doesn't change  - if 'k > 0' as 'x' increase, y increases - as 'x' decreases, 'y' decreases
- $y = 2x$ : this is a Direct Variation, if 'x' goes up, so does 'y'
- $y = mx + b$ : this is also a Direct Variation (if 'b' y intercept is 0 and slope is 2, literally the same as above)
- **Direct Variation as a Power** : $y = kx^n$ : y varies directly with the 'n'th power of x if there exists a real number 'k' such that : $y = kx^n$
- **Inverse Variation** : $\mathbf{y = \frac{k}{x}}$ : For inverse variation, 'y' depends on some constant value 'k', divided by 'x' - We can use our distance formula as an example. Think about using distance as a constant, time now varies inversely with the rate : $\mathbf{d = r t}$ : $\mathbf{r = \frac{d}{t}}$ : $\mathbf{t = \frac{d}{r}}$ - if you increase 'x', then 'y' will decrease, they are inversely related. 
- **Inverse Variation as a Power** : $\mathbf{y = \frac{k}{x^n}}$ : Same as above, just more power. (raised to a power on 'x' independant variable)
- **Joint Variation** : $y = kxz$ : This occurs with the product of two or more variables, sometimes raised to powers - same difficulty, just more tedious -  'y' varies directly from 'x' and 'z' if there is a constant 'k' such that $y = kxz$
- **Solving Variation Problems** :
  1) Start by finding the value for 'k'
  2) rewrite the equation with the known value for 'k'
  3) substitute what is give and solve
### 💰 Joint Variation Problem: Simple Interest
**Problem:** For a given principal, the amount of simple interest earned varies jointly with rate and time. If $9000 was earned after 6 years at 3% annual simple interest, how much would be earned after 10 years at 12% annual simple interest?

**Variation Model:**
$$\mathbf{I = Prt}$$$$\mathbf{I = krt}$$
*Where $I$ is Interest, $r$ is Rate, $t$ is Time, and $k$ is the constant (Principal).*

---

#### 1. Use the First Scenario to Find the Constant ($k$)

**Given:** $I_1 = \$9000$, $t_1 = 6$ years, $r_1 = 3\% = 0.03$.

*Substitute the values into the formula:*
$$9000 = k \cdot (0.03) \cdot (6)$$
$$9000 = k \cdot (0.18)$$

*Solve for the constant $k$ (the Principal):*
$$k = \frac{9000}{0.18}$$
$$\mathbf{k = 50,000}$$

*The constant of variation ($k$) is $\mathbf{\$50,000}$ (the principal amount).*

---

#### 2. Use the Constant ($k$) and the Second Scenario to Find the New Interest ($I_2$)

**Given:** $k = 50,000$, $t_2 = 10$ years, $r_2 = 12\% = 0.12$.

*Use the formula again with the new values:*
$$I_2 = k \cdot r_2 \cdot t_2$$
$$I_2 = 50000 \cdot (0.12) \cdot (10)$$

*Multiply the terms:*
$$I_2 = 50000 \cdot (1.20)$$
$$\mathbf{I_2 = 60,000}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

The amount that would be earned after 10 years at 12% annual simple interest is **\$60,000**.
### 🚗 Inverse Variation Problem: Speed and Time

**Problem:** Over a given distance, speed varies inversely with time. If a car travels a set distance in 10 hours going 110 mph, what speed is needed to go the same distance in 4 hours?

**Model:** Speed ($r$) varies inversely with Time ($t$).
$$\mathbf{rt = k} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{r_1 t_1 = r_2 t_2}$$
*(Where $k$ is the constant distance, $d$)*

---

#### 1. Use the First Scenario to Find the Constant ($k$)

**Given Scenario 1 ($r_1, t_1$):**
* Time ($t_1$): $10$ hours
* Speed ($r_1$): $110$ mph

*Calculate the constant $k$ (the distance):*
$$k = r_1 t_1$$
$$k = (110 \text{ mph}) \cdot (10 \text{ hours})$$
$$\mathbf{k = 1100} \quad \text{(miles)}$$

---

#### 2. Use the Constant ($k$) and the Second Scenario to Find the New Speed ($r_2$)

**Given Scenario 2 ($r_2, t_2$):**
* Distance ($k$): $1100$ miles
* Time ($t_2$): $4$ hours
* Speed ($r_2$): **Unknown**

*Use the formula to solve for $r_2$:*
$$r_2 t_2 = k$$
$$r_2 \cdot (4) = 1100$$
$$r_2 = \frac{1100}{4}$$
$$\mathbf{r_2 = 275}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

The speed needed to go the same distance in 4 hours is **275 mph**.
## Algebra II - Lesson 25 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Graphing - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h35m20s
- The 'Answer' for systems of equations is the **Point of intersection** where both lines touch and satisfies both equations
- For systems of equations, you can test your ordered pair answer (x, y) by plugging in the values to BOTH linear equations and they should both give a true statement like '-3 = -3' or whatever
- **Special Case Scenarios** :
  1) No Solution : Parallel Lines (never touch - same slope) - The system is inconsistent 
  2) Infinite Number of Solutions : Same Line (always touch - same slope) - The equation is dependant
- One Solution = The two lines intersect at one and only one point - The system is consistent and the equations are independant
## Algebra II - Lesson 26 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Substitituion - 29October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h54m5s
- **Solving Linear Systems in two variables with Substitution** :
  1) Solve one of the equations for one of the variables
  2) Substitute for that variable in the other equation
- Substitution works best when you have a coefficient for one of the variables that is a '1' or '-1'
- You should use substitution when one of equations is in the form of 'y = ...' or 'x = ....' and you just need to plug in the known variable into the other equation, then solve for the other unknown (plug in x, solve for y with the new value(solution), find x after solving for 'y' - just typing that out sounds confusing, just be good at math, bro)
- Plug in for the known variable in either original equation, then solve for the other unknown
- the value you use to plug in will be part of the ordered pair, plug in '2' for 'x' and you solve for 'y' and find '7' giving you the ordered pair of (2, 7)
- Check the result : Plug in for 'x' and 'y' in both original equations and make sure that both sides of the equations are balanced '12 = 12' or whatever
### 💡 Solving System of Equations by Substitution (x+y = 5) (-2x -5y = 10)

**Given Equations:**

---

#### 2. Substitute the Expression into the Other Equation

*Substitute the expression for $\mathbf{x}$ (from Eq. 3) into Equation 2.*
$$-2x - 5y = -10$$
$$-2\mathbf{(5 - y)} - 5y = -10$$

---

#### 3. Solve the New Equation for $y$

**A. Distribute:**
$$-10 + 2y - 5y = -10$$

**B. Combine $y$ terms and Constants:**
$$-10 - 3y = -10$$

**C. Isolate $y$:**
*Add 10 to both sides:*
$$-3y = -10 + 10$$
$$-3y = 0$$
$$\mathbf{y = 0}$$

---

#### 4. Substitute $y$ Back to Find $x$

*Substitute $\mathbf{y = 0}$ back into the simplest equation, Equation 3:*
$$x = 5 - y$$
$$x = 5 - (0)$$
$$\mathbf{x = 5}$$

---

#### 5. Final Solution (Point of Intersection)

The solution is the ordered pair $\mathbf{(x, y)}$.
$$\mathbf{(5, 0)}$$

## Algebra II - Lesson 27 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Elimination - 29October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=11h27m45s
- Use elimination when you have one pair of variable terms as opposites like (-5x, 5x) or (-10y, 10y)
- eliminate one of the variables from the system so you have a 1 variable equation that you can solve, which you can then plug back in to one of the original equations and solve for the other variable
- **Standard Form** : $ax + by = c$ : 'a', 'b', and 'c' are real numbers, and both 'a' and 'b' can not be 0
- **Solving Linear Systems in two Variables with Elimination** :
  1) place both equations in $ax + by = c$ : **Standard Form** 
  2) Transform one or both equations in a way that one pair on variable terms are opposites
  3) Add the left sides and set this equal to the sum of the right sides - you will have found the value of one the variables through this step
  4) Solve the resulting equation and find the other unknown using substitution
  5) Check the result: plug in 'x' and 'y' in both original equations - for you to have a solution for a system, it must work in both equations
