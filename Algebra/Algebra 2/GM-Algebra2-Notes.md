## Algebra II - Lesson 1 - Sets 1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
- 'Finite Sets' = have a specific number of elements
- 'Infinite Sets' =  have an unlimited amount of elements
- $\subset$ : 'SubSets' = will contain elements of the main set, 
- $A \subset B$ : 'A' is a 'Proper Subset' of 'B', A = {1, 7, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- $\subseteq$ : 'Improper Subsets' = if 2 sets are equal (have exactly the same elements in different orders) they are considered an 'Improper Subset', G = {1, 8, 2}, D = {2, 1, 8}
- $A \subseteq B$ : 'G' is an 'Improper Subset' of 'D'
- $\mathbf{\not\subset}$ : 'Not a Subset Of' = Symbol for not a subset of, fora set to be a subset of another set, it MUST contain ALL elements from the main set (if even one is missing, it is not a subset)
- $Q \mathbf{\not\subset} L$ : 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L', Q = {a, m, n, o}, L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}, since 'm' is not in the main set 'L' , 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L'
- $2^n$ = How many subsets can be made from a given set, where 'n' is the number of elements in the main set, $\emptyset$ counts as a set (considered a 'possible set')
### Universal Set Example

**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10.

**Universal Set (U):**
$$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$
$$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

---

**Subsets of U:**

**Set A (Even numbers):**
$$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$
$$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$

**Set B (Numbers less than 5):**
$$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$
$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$

**Set C (Odd numbers):**
$$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

---

**Set Notation (Relationships):**

* **Is a member of:** $5 \in U$
* **Is NOT a member of:** $12 \notin U$
* **Is a subset of:** $B \subset U$
* **No solution/Empty Set:** $A \cap C = \emptyset$ (The intersection of A and C is the empty set)

- 'Venn Diagram' = A way to visually represent the relationship between sets
- $\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$ : 'A Complement' or 'A Prime' of Set A (Elements NOT in A) = Will contain all the elements in set 'U' (Universal Set) that ARE NOT members of 'Set A'
- $\cup$  : 'Union' = Will contain everything of the sets that are united(unionized?), without double listing elements
- $A \cup B$ :  Will contain ALL the elements of set 'A' and 'B' without double listing them
-  $\cap$ : 'Intersection' = will contain only the terms in BOTH SETS that are intersected
-  $A \cap B$ : Intersection of set 'A' and 'B' = will contain only the terms that are in BOTH SETS
### Set Operations for Union and Intersection :

**Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$
**Set A:** $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
**Set B:** $$B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

| Symbol/Operation | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$** | **'A Complement'** (Elements NOT in A) = All elements in $U$ that are NOT in $A$. | $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ |
| **$$\cup$$** | **'Union'** = Combine all elements from the sets, without listing duplicates. | $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ |
| **$$A \cup B$$** | Will contain **ALL** the elements of set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}$$ |
| **$$\cap$$** | **'Intersection'** = Contains **only** the elements common to both sets. | $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$ |
| **$$A \cap B$$** | **Intersection of** set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{4, 5\}}$$ |
## Algebra II - Lesson 3 - Solving Linear Equations - 14October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=41m5s
- $ax + b = c$ : first degree linear equation (since 'a' is raised to the first power of 'x')
- 'a', 'b', and 'c' are representing real numbers, 'a' is the coefficient to 'x' and can not be 0
- $2x + 3 = 9$ , $x = 3$ , when you plug in '3' in to x for the equation, it should create a true statement (9=9)
- **'Addition Property Of Equality'** = You can add the same value to both sides of the equation, and it will not effect the solution
- **'Multiplication Property of Equality'** = if you multiply(or divide) one side, you need to mutliply(or divide) the other side as well with the same non-zero number, it will not effect the solution 
- **Steps to Solve** : 1) Simplify Each Side Seperately, 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation, 3) Isolate the Variable, 4) Check the solution in the original equation (To check, just plug in the value you get and check if the equality still holds true)
- Find x : Your main goal is to isolate the variable
## Algebra II - Lesson 4 - Solving Linear Equations in One Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=59m
- To clear an equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by the **LCD (Lowest common denominator)** of alll fractions - clear the equation of fractions to make it easier to get the answer (this isn't mandatory, just makes it easier to work with)
- Problem 1) (completed below, added to anki)

$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$
- $5 x 4 = 20$ , so the LCD is 20, so multiply both sides of the equation by 20, worked equation below 
- The LCD is the smallest number divisible by all these denominators.
- Problem 2) (added to anki)
$$2\left[x - \frac{5}{3}\right] = \frac{11}{3} - \frac{3x}{2}$$
- Similarly when an equation contains decimals, we can clear the decimals by multiplying both sides by the appropriate power of 10
- Problem 3) (completed below, added to anki)
$$-1.8x -2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$
- A good rule to use, is that if you have an equation with decimals, involved, use decimals as the answer - If you have an equation with fractions involved, use fractions as the answer, etc. 
- For most problems with decimals, you just need to use a calculator, and don't have to clear the decimal place, unless explicitly told to show your work, so you will rarely run into these, you should still know how to do it, though
- Problem 4)
$$1.4y - 2.359 = -0.607 - 0.06y$$
- **'Conditional Equation'** = An equation that has exactly one solution ($5x + 1 = 31$ only $x=6$ is a correct answer, where '31 = 31', if you plug any other number in for x, you will not get a true statement)
- '**Contradiction'** = An equation with no solution is referred to as a contradiction (if the 'x' terms cancel eachother out in the equation, so there is no 'x', that is a contradiction, and it will produce a 'false statement' and has 'no solution')
- **'Identity'**= An equation with an unlimited/infinite number of solutions is called an identity ($6-8x=3(2-x)-5x$, $6-8x=6-8x$, $6 = 6$, a true statement and there are an infinite number of solutions where 'x' can be anything)

### Problem 1) Clearing Fractions by Multiplying by the LCD (20)

**Original Equation (Based on visual inspection):**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

**LCD:** The least common multiple of the denominators (5, 4, 5, 5, 2) is **20**.

**Step 1: Multiply every term by the LCD, 20.**
$$20(-x) + 20\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) = 20\left(\frac{-21}{4}\right) + 20\left(\frac{14x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - 20\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$

**Step 2: Cancel denominators and multiply the remainders.**
* $20(-x) = \mathbf{-20x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(x) = \mathbf{4x}$
* $20/4 = 5 \implies 5(-21) = \mathbf{-105}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(14x) = \mathbf{56x}$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(3) = \mathbf{12}$
* $20/2 = 10 \implies -10(x) = \mathbf{-10x}$

**Intermediate Result (No Fractions):**
$$-20x + 4x = -105 + 56x + 12 - 10x$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms on each side.**
* **Left Side (x-terms):** $-20x + 4x = \mathbf{-16x}$
* **Right Side (x-terms):** $56x - 10x = \mathbf{46x}$
* **Right Side (Constants):** $-105 + 12 = \mathbf{-93}$

**Final Equation Ready to Solve:**
$$-16x = 46x - 93$$
**Step 1: Isolate x-terms by subtracting 46x from both sides.** $$-16x - 46x = -93$$ $$-62x = -93$$ **Step 2: Solve for x by dividing both sides by -62.** $$x = \frac{-93}{-62}$$ **Step 3: Simplify the fraction.** Both 93 and 62 are divisible by 31 (since $93 = 3 \times 31$ and $62 = 2 \times 31$). The negative signs cancel. $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$ $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$ **Check for Excluded Values:** The original denominators were 5, 4, 5, 5, and 2. Since none of the original denominators contained the variable $x$, there are **no excluded values ($\emptyset$)**. Therefore, the solution is valid. **Final Solution:** $$x = \frac{3}{2}$$
### Problem 1) Solving the Equation WITHOUT a Full LCD Strategy = Same Result, more steps, harder

**Original Equation:**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{x}{2}$$

***

**Step 1: Simplify the Left Side (Common Denominator is 5).**
$$-x + \frac{x}{5} = \frac{-5x}{5} + \frac{x}{5} = \mathbf{\frac{-4x}{5}}$$

**Step 2: Simplify Constants on the Right Side (Common Denominator is 5 for the two constant fractions).**
$$\frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \left( \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} \right)$$
*Combine constants with common denominator 20:*
$$\frac{-21}{4} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{-21 \cdot 5}{20} + \frac{3 \cdot 4}{20} = \frac{-105 + 12}{20} = \mathbf{\frac{-93}{20}}$$

**New Equation:**
$$\frac{-4x}{5} = \frac{14x}{5} - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 3: Move all x-terms to the Left Side.**

$$\frac{-4x}{5} - \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

**Step 4: Combine the first two x-terms (Common Denominator 5).**
$$\frac{-4x - 14x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-18x}{5} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 5: Combine the remaining x-terms (Common Denominator is 10).**
$$\frac{-18x \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 2} + \frac{x \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-36x}{10} + \frac{5x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$
$$\frac{-31x}{10} = \frac{-93}{20}$$

***

**Step 6: Solve for x.**

1.  **Cross-Multiply (Allowed because it's Fraction = Fraction):**
    $$-31x \cdot 20 = -93 \cdot 10$$
    $$-620x = -930$$

2.  **Divide both sides by -620:**
    $$x = \frac{-930}{-620}$$
    $$x = \frac{93}{62}$$

3.  **Simplify (Divide by 31):**
    $$x = \frac{93 \div 31}{62 \div 31}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$

**Final Solution:**
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{3}{2}}$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 1: Linear Equations - Clearing Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Multiply the entire equation by 100 (LCD of 1, 10, 100).**
$$100(-1.8x - 2.06x) = 100(-2.9x + 2.4)$$

**Resulting Integer Equation:**
$$-180x - 206x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 2: Combine Like Terms.**
$$-386x = -290x + 240$$

**Step 3: Isolate x-terms (Add 290x to both sides).**
$$-386x + 290x = 240$$
$$-96x = 240$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -96).**
$$x = \frac{240}{-96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify (Divide numerator and denominator by 48).**
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
### Problem 3 - Solution Method 2: Linear Equations - Solving with Decimals

**Original Equation:**
$$-1.8x - 2.06x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 1: Combine Like Terms on the Left Side.**
$$(-1.8 - 2.06)x = -3.86x$$
$$-3.86x = -2.9x + 2.4$$

**Step 2: Isolate x-terms (Add 2.9x to both sides).**
$$-3.86x + 2.9x = 2.4$$

**Step 3: Combine x-terms.**
$$(-3.86 + 2.9)x = -0.96x$$
$$-0.96x = 2.4$$

**Step 4: Solve for x (Divide by -0.96).**
$$x = \frac{2.4}{-0.96}$$

**Step 5: Simplify to Fraction/Decimal.**
*(To simplify the calculation, temporarily multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: $\frac{240}{-96}$)*
$$x = -\frac{240}{96}$$
$$x = -\frac{5}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.5$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 5 - Converting a Repeating Decimal into a Fraction - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h30m20s
- **Repeating Decimal** = A decimal that repeats the same digit or pattern of digits forever.
- Examples of Repeating Decimals :

|    Fraction     |     Decimal Representation     | Read As                                                |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|  $\frac{1}{3}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{3}}$      | Zero point three repeating                             |
|  $\frac{1}{6}$  |     $0.1\mathbf{\bar{6}}$      | Zero point one six repeating                           |
|  $\frac{1}{9}$  |      $0.\mathbf{\bar{1}}$      | Zero point one repeating                               |
| $\frac{2}{11}$  |   $0.\mathbf{\overline{18}}$   | Zero point one eight repeating                         |
| $\frac{5}{12}$  |     $0.41\mathbf{\bar{6}}$     | Zero point four one six repeating                      |
|  $\frac{1}{7}$  | $0.\mathbf{\overline{142857}}$ | Zero point one four two eight five seven repeating     |
| $\frac{44}{45}$ |   $0.9\mathbf{\overline{7}}$   | Zero point nine seven, repeating infinitely, of course |
- 44/45 = 0.97 repeating = he does a bunch of things where he multiplies the equation by 10, get's 8.8, then subtract x, then multiply by 10(again), then divide by 90.... bro, just round up or down, this is tedious just watching, I'm not typing all that out
- $10^n$ where $^n$ is the number of digits in the repeating string (so if 2 digits repeat infinitely, then do 2, etc)
## Algebra II - Lesson 6 - Solving for a Specified Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1h48m45s
- d = rt (distance = rate * time)
- r = d/t (rate of speed = distance / time)
- t = d/r (time = distance / rate)
- You can manipulate your formulas to get what you need out of it
- p = 2l + 2w (perimeter of a rectangle = 2 Length + 2 Width)
-  p = 40 feet, w = 7 feet, you can now solve the equation to find the missing variable
- f = 9/5c + 32 (fahrenheit = 9/5 celsius + 32)
- multiply a fraction by its reciprocal to cancel it out 9/5c * 5/9c, what you do on one side do on the other
- 5/9(f-32) = c
## Algebra II - Lesson 7 - Applications of Linear Equations I - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h9m10s
- how to decode word problems so they make sense, and you can turn them into an equation to use :
- **Common Addition Phrases** = 'The Sum Of', 'More Than', 'Plus', 'Added to', 'Increased by', 
- **Phrases for Subtraction** = 'Less than', 'Less', 'Decreased by', 'Minus', 'Subtracted From'
- **Phrases for Multiplication** = 'Times', 'Multiplied by', 'Of'(fractions), 'Product of'
- **Phrases for Division** = 'Quotient of', 'Divided by', 
- **Is Means Equals** = Is = Equals
- **Commutative** = placement doesn't matter, addition and multiplication are commutative, subtraction and division are not (the order matters where you put the '-' or '/' sign on the terms), so take your time when you are reading so you know where to place the symbols correctly, how many times have I gotten something wrong because I left out a '-' or forgot to simplify
## Algebra II - Lesson 8 - Applications of Linear Equations II - 16October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h30m
- There are generally only 3 types of word problems you will run into during Algebra I / II
- 6 Step Process to Solving a word problem :
1) Read the problem and determine the question(s) to be answered
2) Assign a variable to represent the unknown, sometimes more than one unknown
3) Write an equation
4) Solve an equation
5) Write the answer in terms of the question(s) asked 
6) Check the answer using the words of the problem
- Problem 1) Marci and Steven are siblings. Marci is four years older than Steven. If their combined age is 34, how old is Marci? How old is Steven? 
  **'S' = Stevens Age, 
  'M' = Marcis Age(S +4).**  
  $S + (S+4) = 34$ 
  $2S + 4 = 34$
  $2S = 30$
  $S = 15$
  Steven is 15 years old, while Marci is 19 years old. 
  Doing it starting with Marcis age :
  M = S + S - 4 = 34 
  2S = 38
  M = 19
  M - 4 = S
  S = 15
- Problem 2) During the **16-game** 2012 NFL regular season, **the Broncos, Chargers, and Raiders combined to win a total of 24 games.** The Chargers won 3 more games than the Raiders but won 6 fewer games than the Broncos. Find the regular season win/loss record for each team. 
  **X =  Number of games won by the chargers**
  **X - 3 = Number of games won by the raiders**
  **X+6 = Number of games won by the broncos**
  $X + X -3 + X + 6 = 24$
  3X + 3 = 24
  3X = 21
  X = 7 
  There are 7 games won by the chargers and lost 9 games, 4 games won by the raiders and lost 12, and 13 games won by the broncos and lost 3. 
- Problem 3)  Mark's retail clothing store currently has an inventory level of $585,000. This was an increase of 150% from one year ago. How much was the value of the inventory one year ago?
  **X = The value of inventory one year ago**
  X + 1.5X = 585,000$
  2.5X = 585,000$
  X = 234,000$
  The value of the inventory one year ago was 234,000$
- Problem 4) (added to anki) Gene invested $2000 for 3 years and earned a total of $300 in simple interest. What was his interest rate?
  **I = prt**, I = interest, p = principal, r = rate, t = time
  I / pt = r 
  300 / (2000)(3) = r
  r = 0.05 
  The interest rate was 5%.
## Algebra II - Lesson 9 - Applications of Linear Equations III - 17October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=2h53m36s
- Problem 1) (added to anki) An alcohol solution was made by mixing **3 gallons of an 80% alcohol solution** and **4 gallons of a 52% alcohol solution**. Find the concentratiowf the new mixture. 
   $\frac{Pure amount of the substance}{Total amount of the mixture} = concentration of the substance$ Pure amount of the substance / Total amount of the mixture = concentration of the substance (mathjax formattingiswierd)
   3 Gallons of 80% = 3 * 0.8 = 2.4 gallons
   4 gallons of 52% = 4 * 0.52 = 2.08 gallons
   $\frac{2.4 + 2.08}{3 + 4}$ = 0.64 = 64%
   The new mixture is 64% alcohol
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
### Problem 2) Mixture Problem: Solving for Fruit Punch Gallons
-  Problem 2) (answered below, added to anki) Jennifer asked you to make **12 gallons** of fruit punch that contains **48% fruit juice** by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?

**Goal:** Create 12 gallons of 48% fruit juice.
**Mixtures:** Betty's (38% juice) and Calvin's (53% juice).

---

#### 1. Define Variables

Let $B$ be the number of gallons of **Betty's** juice (38%).
Let $C$ be the number of gallons of **Calvin's** juice (53%).

---

#### 2. Set Up the System of Equations

We need two equations: one for the **Total Volume** and one for the **Total Amount of Pure Juice**.

**Equation 1: Total Volume (Gallons)**
The gallons of Betty's plus the gallons of Calvin's must equal the final 12 gallons.
$$B + C = 12$$

**Equation 2: Total Pure Juice (Juice Content)**
The amount of pure juice from Betty's ($0.38B$) plus the amount of pure juice from Calvin's ($0.53C$) must equal the amount of pure juice in the final mixture ($48\%$ of 12 gallons).
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 0.48(12)$$
$$0.38B + 0.53C = 5.76$$

---

#### 3. Solve the System (Using Substitution)

It's easiest to solve Equation 1 for $B$ and substitute it into Equation 2.

**A. Isolate B (from Eq 1):**
$$B = 12 - C$$

**B. Substitute (12 - C) into Eq 2:**
$$0.38(12 - C) + 0.53C = 5.76$$

**C. Distribute and Simplify:**
$$4.56 - 0.38C + 0.53C = 5.76$$
$$4.56 + 0.15C = 5.76$$

**D. Isolate C (Subtract 4.56 from both sides):**
$$0.15C = 5.76 - 4.56$$
$$0.15C = 1.20$$

**E. Solve for C (Divide by 0.15):**
$$C = \frac{1.20}{0.15}$$
$$\mathbf{C = 8 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 4. Find B (Substitute C=8 back into B = 12 - C)

$$B = 12 - 8$$
$$\mathbf{B = 4 \text{ gallons}}$$

---

#### 5. Final Answer

**Betty's Juice (38%):** 4 gallons
**Calvin's Juice (53%):** 8 gallons

### Problem 3) Word Problem: Multi-Constraint System (Bill Totals)
- Problem 3) (answered below, added to anki) For a bill totaling $1105, a clerk received: hundreds, twenties, and ones only.  There were 6 times as many 20's as 100's and 25 fewer 1's than 20's. How much of each type of bill was received?

**Problem Equation:** $$100H + 20T + 1O = 1105$$

**Constraints (in terms of x=T):**
* $T = x$
* $H = T/6 \implies H = x/6$
* $O = T - 25 \implies O = x - 25$

---

#### 1. Formulate the Equation

Substitute all variables into the value equation:
$$100\left(\frac{x}{6}\right) + 20x + (x - 25) = 1105$$

#### 2. Simplify and Solve

**A. Simplify Coefficients:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 20x + x - 25 = 1105$$

**B. Combine $x$ terms and move constant:**
$$\frac{50x}{3} + 21x = 1105 + 25$$
$$\frac{50x}{3} + \frac{63x}{3} = 1130$$

**C. Combine fractions:**
$$\frac{113x}{3} = 1130$$

**D. Solve for x:**
$$113x = 3390$$
$$x = \frac{3390}{113}$$
$$\mathbf{x = 30}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

* $T = x = 30$ (Twenties)
* $H = x/6 = 30/6 = 5$ (Hundreds)
* $O = x - 25 = 30 - 25 = 5$ (Ones)
### Problem 4) Word Problem: Uniform Motion (Catch-Up Time)
- Problem 4) (solved below, added to anki) A passenger plane left Rome and flew south. 2 hours later, a cargo plane left from the same location and flew 80mph faster in an effort to catch up. After 7 hours of flying, the cargo plane caught up. What was the passenger plane's average rate of speed in mph?
**Goal:** Find the average rate of speed ($P$) of the passenger plane.

**Key Principle:** The distance traveled by both planes is equal ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$).

---

#### 1. Determine Time and Rate Variables

| Plane | Rate (R) | Time (T) | Distance (D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passenger (P)** | $P$ | $7 \text{ hrs} + 2 \text{ hrs} = 9$ | $9P$ |
| **Cargo (C)** | $P + 80$ | $7$ hrs | $7(P + 80)$ |

---

#### 2. Set Up the Equation ($D_{\text{passenger}} = D_{\text{cargo}}$)

$$9P = 7(P + 80)$$

#### 3. Solve for P

**A. Distribute:**
$$9P = 7P + 560$$

**B. Isolate the variable:** Subtract $7P$ from both sides.
$$9P - 7P = 560$$
$$2P = 560$$

**C. Final Division:**
$$P = \frac{560}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{P = 280}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

The passenger plane's average rate of speed was **280 mph**.

## Algebra II - Lesson 10 - Interval Notation - 17October2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=12361s
- **Interval Notation** = Allows us to notate a specific range of numbers on a number line
- **Set Builder Notation** = { x | x has a certain property } syntax
- {x | -2 < x < 5 } = The set of all elements in set X  such that x is greater than -2 and less than 5
- {x | x = 7 } = Set builder notation for saying 'the set of all elements x | such that x = 7'
- x > 7 = you can use an open circle on a number line or a parnthesis '(' and shade on the number line to indicate that it continues
- X >= 5 = x greater than equal to 5 = use a filled in circle or a '[' bracket and shade after to show the solution region
- x < 3 = use an open circle or a parenthesis ')' and shade before 
- x <= -4 = x is less than equal to negative 4 = filled in circle or bracket ']' and shade everything to the left
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- $(-\infty, 5]$  Negative infinity, less than equal to 5, note that infinity needs a negative sign and a parenthesis
## Algebra II - Lesson 11 - Linear Inequalities in One Variable - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=13687s
- $ax+b<c$ : a, b, and c are real numbers. a is not allowed to be 0. 
- The main difference between an equation('=') and inequalitie is the greater/less than symbol
- Same as always, you are trying to find 'x', isolate the value by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing
- **The Multiplication Property of Inequality** = If you multiply both sides by any non-zero positive number, it won't effect the final solution. *If you multiply both sides by a negative number, YOU MUST FLIP THE DIRECTION OF THE INEQUALITY SYMBOL* : Also when you are *dividing by a negative, you need to flip the signs as well*
- big number not always bigger says grug, -2 > -5,  -5 is still the smaller number
- **Interval Notation** = (smallest value, largest value), so if x <= 6 = $(-\infty, 6]$, the ']' bracket indicates that six is part of the solution, always use a parenthesis with infinity
- '(' ')' parenthesis exclude a number from the interval (2, 5) = anything larger than 2, anything less than 5, excluding 2 and 5 or '2 < x < 5'
- '[' ']' when you want to include a number, use a bracket [7, 9] : 7 <=  x <= 9 = x is greater than equal to 7, less than equal to 9
- To check your inequality : Change the inequality to '=' and check if 'x' is = to a true statement, establish solution and non solution regions/boundaries, then check one on each side, tedious
- Graphing : same as above, this video is largely just review, open circle excluded, fully filled circle for included or use parenthesis/brackets, and shade the solution area
- **Three Part Inequality** = '8 < 8 -5a < 38' : '8 -5a' is greater than 8, and less than 38, both conditions need to be met, 2 options : seperate and solve and put back together, or solve and do same thing to each part by isolating 'a' in middle and do everything to both sides : subtract '8' from both sides and divide both sides by '-5' to isolate, since you are dividing by a negative, the equality signs must flip : '0 > a > -6', but you need to rearrange, so, flip the symbols again, '-6 < a < 0' = 'a' is greater than negative six and less than 0 : or (-6, 0) for interval notation
## Algebra II - Lesson 12 - Compound Inequalities - 18October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=4h19m
- **Compound Inequality** = A compound inequality consists of two inequalities linked by **And** or **Or**
- **And** inequality how to solve steps : 1) Solve each inequality seperately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *both inequalities* - if you don't get a solution that can satisfy BOTH inequalities / overlap - then you have NO SOLUTION
- **Or** inequalities and how to solve steps : 1) solve each inequality separately, 2) the solution set contains all numbers that satisfy *either inequality* - if you have an element that is common to both, list it only once. The *union* of the two sets.
### Compound Inequalities

**Definition:** Two or more inequalities joined by the words **AND** or **OR**.

| Type | Definition | Solution Set |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AND** | The variable must satisfy **BOTH** inequalities. (Intersection) | The overlapping region on the number line. |
| **OR** | The variable must satisfy **AT LEAST ONE** of the inequalities. (Union) | All regions covered by either inequality. |

---

#### Case 1: "AND" Compound Inequality (Intersection)

**Problem:** Solve $-5 < 2x + 1 \le 11$

**Step 1: Isolate the variable ($x$) in the middle.**
* Subtract 1 from all three parts:
    $$-5 - 1 < 2x + 1 - 1 \le 11 - 1$$
    $$-6 < 2x \le 10$$

**Step 2: Solve for $x$.**
* Divide all three parts by 2:
    $$\frac{-6}{2} < \frac{2x}{2} \le \frac{10}{2}$$
    $$\mathbf{-3 < x \le 5}$$

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Overlap):**
* Since $x$ must be greater than $-3$ AND less than or equal to $5$, the solution is a single interval.
    $$\mathbf{(-3, 5]}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid -3 < x \le 5\}}$$

---

#### Case 2: "OR" Compound Inequality (Union)

**Problem:** Solve $3x + 4 \le 10$ **OR** $x - 7 > 2$

**Step 1: Solve each inequality separately.**

| Left Inequality (OR) | Right Inequality (OR) |
| :--- | :--- |
| $3x + 4 \le 10$ | $x - 7 > 2$ |
| $3x \le 6$ | $x > 9$ |
| $\mathbf{x \le 2}$ | $\mathbf{x > 9}$ |

**Step 2: Combine the solutions using "OR".**
* The solution includes all values $\le 2$ *plus* all values $> 9$.

**Step 3: Interval Notation (The Combined Regions):**
* Use the **Union** symbol ($\cup$) to join the two separate intervals.
    $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 2] \cup (9, \infty)}$$

**Step 4: Set Notation:**
$$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \le 2 \text{ or } x > 9\}}$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=5h30m40s
- Where? How? **Absolute Value** means the distance away from '0' so you need a positive and negative. 
- For absolute value inequalities, you will need a negative AND a positive for each one - **The sign will also be flipped when doing the opposite values** 
- *When dividing or multiplying by a negative, don't forget to FLIP the sign*
- For > greater than you need to use an 'OR' with a compound inequality, for < less than you need to use an 'AND' to get the correct solution sets, formulas/syntax below :
- |x| > k : x > k OR x < -k
- |x| < k : x < k AND x > -k
- Make sure you ISOLATE the absolute value operation as much as you can before making your inequality statements, aka clear everything OUTSIDE of the '| |' absolutes must be worked into the inequality, for example : '7|10k + 3| + 7 < 28' should be worked down to : '|10k +3| < 3' BEFORE doing your 'AND' or 'OR' statements
- Problem 1) (added to anki)
   |x| $\ge$ 2 : So you will need both a negative and positive for these as well, so $(-\infty, -2) \cup (2, \infty)$ is the solution set (any number that is less than $\le$ -2 Union with any number that is  $\ge$ greater than equal to 2)

## Algebra II - Lesson 15 - Linear Equations in Two Variables - 20October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h3m10s
- Linear equations with only one variable generally only have one answer (find x, oh look, there it is) - with 2 variables, there is no longer one solution, there is an infinite number of solutions
- **Standard Form of a Linear Equation** : **ax + by = c** A linear equation in two variables is of the form : **ax + by = c** , 'a' 'b' and 'c' are real numbers, 'a' and 'b' can not be '0' zero at the same time
- If there are exponents (besides ^1), then it is not a linear equation. For example :  $ax^2 + by^2 = c$ is not a linear equation
- **Ordered Pair** = A solution to a linear equation in two variables is called an ordered pair : **(x, y)** - *'X' is always first, 'Y' is always second*
- To solve a linear equation with 2 variables, plug in a number for one of the variables, and solve for the other one. - Pick something for 'X', solve for 'Y'. Pick something for 'Y', solve for 'X'
- **Table of Values** : Many ordered pairs, used for graphing, if a value for 'x' is -, you get - for 'Y'  
### Table of Values for $4x - 3y = -12$

| $x$ | $y$ | Calculation |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **0** | **4** | $4(0) - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -12 \implies y = 4$ |
| **-3** | **0** | $4x - 3(0) = -12 \implies 4x = -12 \implies x = -3$ |
| **3** | **8** | $4(3) - 3y = -12 \implies 12 - 3y = -12 \implies -3y = -24 \implies y = 8$ |

**Completed Points:** $(0, 4)$, $(-3, 0)$, and $(3, 8)$.

### Table of Values for $-x + 7y = 28$

|  $x$   |  $y$  | Calculation                                                            |
| :----: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7**  | **5** | $-7 + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 35 \implies y = 5$                         |
| **-7** | **3** | $-x + 7(3) = 28 \implies -x + 21 = 28 \implies -x = 7 \implies x = -7$ |
| **0**  | **4** | $-(0) + 7y = 28 \implies 7y = 28 \implies y = 4$                       |
**Completed Points:** $(7, 5)$, $(-7, 3)$, and $(0, 4)$.

- What do you with your ordered pairs? You plot them on your **coordinate plane** aka graphing
- **Cartesian Coordinate System** = sum ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum. A fancy way to say graph
- **Rectangular Coordinate System** = yet another name for a graph
- **Origin** = **(0, 0)** 
- **X-Axis** = Goes left to right, Horizontal
- **Y-Axis** = Goes up and down, Vertical
- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)

- **Quadrants** = 4 Quadrants, Counterclockwise : Quadrant I = Top right, (+, +) - Quadrant II = Top Left (-, +) - Quadrant III = Bottom Left (-, -) - Quadrant IV = Bottom Right (+, -)
- After plotting your ordered pairs, you should get a line, draw a line through it, with arrows to indicate that it keeps going, commonly you would label the line with the equation
- **X Intercept** = Where your graph crosses the X-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'x' and solve for 'y'
- **Y-Intercept** = Where your graph cross the Y-Axis, to find this, simply plug '0' into 'y' and solve for 'x'
- **The Intercept Method** = '0' is easy to work with, so just find the 'x intercept' and 'y intercept' - you can graph it with just 2 points, but you want one arbitrary point as a check, you want to end up with integers, not decimals or fractions
- **ax + by +c(0)** We often see equations whose 'x' and 'y' intercepts occurs at the origin (0,0), this will always have a 'c'= 0 zero
- **y = k**  = Graphing horizontal lines will have an equation like this - Y will always be the same, no matter what (it's flat, horizontal straight line, forever), no matter what you plug in for 'x' it will always be the same 'y'
- **x = k** = Graphing a vertical line will have an equation like this, since 'y = 0', x will always have the same value, and be vertical
### Graphing $-x + 4y = -4$ using the Intercept Method

**Equation:** $-x + 4y = -4$

---

#### 1. Find the x-intercept (Set $y = 0$)

* Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-x + 4(0) = -4$$
    $$-x = -4$$
    $$x = 4$$
* **x-intercept point:** **$(4, 0)$**

---

#### 2. Find the y-intercept (Set $x = 0$)

* Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:
    $$-(0) + 4y = -4$$
    $$4y = -4$$
    $$y = -1$$
* **y-intercept point:** **$(0, -1)$**

---

#### 3. Plotting Points and Check Point

* **Plot these two intercepts:** $(4, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$.
* Draw a straight line connecting them.

* **Check Point:** $(8, 1)$
    * Substitute $x = 8$ and $y = 1$ into the original equation:
        $$-(8) + 4(1) = -4$$
        $$-8 + 4 = -4$$
        $$-4 = -4 \quad \checkmark$$
    * Since $-4 = -4$, the point $(8, 1)$ **is on the line**. This confirms our line is drawn correctly.

## Algebra II - Lesson 17 - The Slope of a Line - 21October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=6h54m
- **Slope** = $\frac{Rise}{Run}$ = The ratio of vertical change (Rise) to horizontal change (Run) 
- **Slope Formula from 2 points** = $m = \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$ = 'm' stands for slope, $x1 -x2 \neq 0$, You can not divide by 0, so make sure the 2 points you pick don't equal 0 when subtracted
- **Subscript** = $y2$ = y sub 2 = the number after the variable is called a subscript - the order you place the subscripts on the ordered pairs (x, y) doesn't matter, you will get the same result regardless, just be consistent
- $m = -\frac{5}{8}$ if the slope is negative, you can swap it, if the rise goes down 5, the run is eight, if the rise goes up 5, the run goes back 8 - a negative value on y = you are going down, a negative value on the x means it goes to the left
- y = 3 : The slope of any horizontal line is always zero - no matter what you choose for 'x', 'y' is always 3
- x = -4 : The slope of a vertical line is 'undefined' (since you are dividing by 0)
- $+\frac{3}{5}$ = A positively sloped line rises as we move to the right (x+, y+)
- $+\frac{3}{2}$a negatively sloped line goes down as we move to the right (x+, y-)
- $y = mx + b$ = slope intercept form, 'm' is the slope, 'b' is the y intercept - so just solve the equation for 'y' and the coefficient of 'x' is the slope
### Slope Calculation : (-13,2) (19,-18)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-13, 2) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -13, y_1 = 2$$
$$P_2 = (19, -18) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 19, y_2 = -18$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{-18 - 2}{19 - (-13)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{-20}{19 + 13}$$
$$m = \frac{-20}{32}$$

**Step 3: Reduce the fraction.**
*Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF (4):*
$$m = \frac{-20 \div 4}{32 \div 4}$$
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{5}{8}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{5}{8}$$
### Slope Calculation (15, -10) (10, 6)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (15, -10) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = 15, y_1 = -10$$
$$P_2 = (10, 6) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = 10, y_2 = 6$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{6 - (-10)}{10 - 15}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{6 + 10}{-5}$$
$$m = \frac{16}{-5}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -\frac{16}{5}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -\frac{16}{5}$$
### Slope Calculation (-7, -9) (-14, 12)

**Given Points:**
$$P_1 = (-7, -9) \quad \implies \quad x_1 = -7, y_1 = -9$$
$$P_2 = (-14, 12) \quad \implies \quad x_2 = -14, y_2 = 12$$

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Step 1: Substitute the values.**
$$m = \frac{12 - (-9)}{-14 - (-7)}$$

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.**
$$m = \frac{12 + 9}{-14 + 7}$$
$$m = \frac{21}{-7}$$

**Step 3: Write the final reduced slope.**
$$\mathbf{m = -3}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = -3$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (x-y = 28)

**Equation:**
$$x - y = 28$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract x from both sides:*
$$-y = -x + 28$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-x + 28)$$
$$y = x - 28$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$y = \mathbf{1}x - 28$$
$$\mathbf{m = 1}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 1$$
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (6x - y = 8)

**Equation:**
$$6x - y = -8$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $6x$ from both sides:*
$$-y = -6x - 8$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Multiply or divide both sides by -1:*
$$(-1)(-y) = (-1)(-6x - 8)$$
$$y = 6x + 8$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = 6}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = 6$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=7h23m15s
- **y = mx + b** : The quickest way to get the slope is to solve for 'y' aka 'slop intercept form'
- Slope intercept form is also the fastest way to graph a linear equation with 2 variables
- **Perpendicular Lines** =  2 perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1, they will intersect at a 90 degree angle $$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$
- **Parralel Lines** = 2 non vertical lines that have the same slope are parallel ( if 2 lines have the same slope, but a different y-intercept, they are parallel)
### Perpendicular Lines Rule

**Rule:** Two non-vertical lines are perpendicular if and only if their slopes ($m_1$ and $m_2$) are **opposite reciprocals**.

**Formula (Condition for Perpendicularity):**
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}}$$

**Alternatively:** The product of their slopes must equal $-1$.
$$\mathbf{m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1}$$

**Steps to Find the Perpendicular Slope:**
1.  **Flip** the original slope (find the reciprocal).
2.  **Change the sign** (find the opposite).

**Example:**
* If $m_1 = \frac{4}{5}$, then $m_2 = -\frac{5}{4}$.
* If $m_1 = -3$, then $m_2 = \frac{1}{3}$.
### Finding the Slope from Standard Form (5x - 4y = 12)

**Equation:**
$$5x - 4y = -12$$

**Step 1: Isolate the y-term.**
*Subtract $5x$ from both sides:*
$$-4y = -5x - 12$$

**Step 2: Solve for positive y.**
*Divide every term on both sides by -4:*
$$\frac{-4y}{-4} = \frac{-5x}{-4} - \frac{12}{-4}$$
$$y = \frac{5}{4}x + 3$$

**Step 3: Identify the slope (m).**
The equation is now in the form $y = mx + b$. The coefficient of $x$ is the slope ($m$).
$$\mathbf{m = \frac{5}{4}}$$

**Final Slope:**
$$m = \frac{5}{4}$$
### Solving Linear Equations (x+3y =12) (4x-3y = 3)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$, meaning their slopes are opposite reciprocals.

**Equations:**
1.  $$x + 3y = 12$$
2.  $$4x - 3y = 3$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$x + 3y = 12$$
$$3y = -x + 12$$
$$y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 4$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$4x - 3y = 3$$
$$-3y = -4x + 3$$
$$y = \frac{-4x}{-3} + \frac{3}{-3}$$
$$y = \frac{4}{3}x - 1$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{3}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{1}{3}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{3}$.*

* Are they **opposite reciprocals**?
    * The reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $-3$.
    * The opposite reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{3}$ is $\mathbf{+3}$.
* **Since $\frac{4}{3} \neq 3$**, the lines are **NOT** perpendicular.

---

**Conclusion:**
The slopes are $\mathbf{-\frac{1}{3}}$ and $\mathbf{\frac{4}{3}}$. Since their product is $\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = -\frac{4}{9} \neq -1$, the lines are **NOT perpendicular or parallel**.
### Solving Perpendicular Linear Equations (7x + 4y = 8) (-4x + 7y = -21)

**Rule:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2$) is $\mathbf{-1}$.

**Equations:**
1.  $$7x + 4y = 8$$
2.  $$-4x + 7y = -21$$

---

#### 1. Find the Slope of Line 1 ($m_1$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_1x + b$):*
$$7x + 4y = 8$$
$$4y = -7x + 8$$
$$y = \frac{-7}{4}x + 2$$
$$\mathbf{m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}}$$

---

#### 2. Find the Slope of Line 2 ($m_2$)

*Convert to slope-intercept form ($y = m_2x + b$):*
$$-4x + 7y = -21$$
$$7y = 4x - 21$$
$$y = \frac{4}{7}x - 3$$
$$\mathbf{m_2 = \frac{4}{7}}$$

---

#### 3. Check the Perpendicularity Condition

*Compare the slopes: $m_1 = -\frac{7}{4}$ and $m_2 = \frac{4}{7}$.*

* **Opposite Reciprocal Check:**
    * The reciprocal of $\frac{7}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{7}$.
    * The opposite sign of a negative slope is positive.
    * The slopes are indeed opposite reciprocals.

* **Product Check:**
    $$m_1 \cdot m_2 = \left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{7}\right) = \mathbf{-1 \quad (\checkmark)}$$

---

**Conclusion:**
Since $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$, the lines are **perpendicular**.

- **Slope-Intercept Form** = **y = mx + b** m = slope (coefficient of 'x) + b(y intercept)
- **Point - Slope Form** = $\mathbf{y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)}$ : Use this when you know the slope and a single point on the line, or you have 2 points, solve for 'y' and get slope intercept form
- **Standard Form** = $ax + by = c$ : write a and b like that, and 'a' or 'b' can not by '0' for standard form, strict definition 'a' 'b' and 'c' are integers (no fractions/decimals) 'a' 'b' 'c' can have no common factor except 1
### Point-Slope Form Formula

---

**Term Definitions:**

| Term | Meaning | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **$y$ and $x$** | **Variables** | Represent any point $(x, y)$ that lies on the line. They are the variables that remain in the final equation. |
| **$m$** | **Slope** | The steepness or rate of change of the line. It is calculated as "rise over run" ($\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$). |
| **$y_1$ and $x_1$** | **Specific Point** | The known, single ordered pair $(\mathbf{x_1}, \mathbf{y_1})$ that the line passes through. |

**Purpose:** This form is used when you know the **slope ($m$)** and one **point $(x_1, y_1)$** of a line. It is often the first step before converting the equation to the final slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$).

$$y - 3 = \left(\frac{2}{3} \cdot x\right) + \left(\frac{2}{3} \cdot 3\right)$$
$$y - 3 = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$$

#### 3. Isolate $y$ (Slope-Intercept Form)

*Add 3 to both sides:*
$$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2 + 3$$

$$y = -\frac{3}{2}x - 2$$

#### 2. Eliminate the Fraction

*To remove the denominator of 2, multiply every term by **2**.*
$$2 \cdot y = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{2}x\right) - 2 \cdot 2$$
$$2y = -3x - 4$$

* Parallel to: $\mathbf{y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3}$

**Goal:** Find the equation of the new line in Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$).

---

#### 1. Determine the Slope of the New Line

* **Rule for Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the **same slope**.
* The given line $y = -\frac{7}{5}x + 3$ is in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), so its slope is $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.
* Therefore, the slope of our new line is also $\mathbf{m = -\frac{7}{5}}$.

---

#### 2. Use Point-Slope Form

* Use the slope $m = -\frac{7}{5}$ and the given point $(x_1, y_1) = (-5, 3)$.
* **Point-Slope Formula:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x - (-5))$$
    $$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}(x + 5)$$

---

#### 3. Convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

**A. Distribute the slope:**
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot 5\right)$$
$$y - 3 = -\frac{7}{5}x - 7$$

**B. Eliminate the fraction:**
* Multiply every term by **5** to clear the denominator.
    $$5(y) - 5(3) = 5\left(-\frac{7}{5}x\right) - 5(7)$$
    $$5y - 15 = -7x - 35$$

**C. Rearrange to $Ax + By = C$ (ensure A is positive):**
* Move the $x$-term ($-7x$) to the left side by adding $7x$ to both sides.
* Move the constant term ($-15$) to the right side by adding $15$ to both sides.
    $$7x + 5y - 15 = -35$$
    $$7x + 5y = -35 + 15$$
    $$\mathbf{7x + 5y = -20}$$

---

**Goal:** Find the equation of a line perpendicular to $y = 2x - 1$ and passing through $(2, -3)$, then convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$).

---

#### 1. Determine the Slope of the New Line ($m$)

* **Given Line Slope ($m_{\text{given}}$):** The slope of $y = 2x - 1$ is $\mathbf{m_{\text{given}} = 2}$.
* **Rule for Perpendicular Lines:** The slope of the new line ($m$) must be the **opposite reciprocal** of $m_{\text{given}}$.
    $$\mathbf{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

---

#### 2. Use Point-Slope Form

* Use the perpendicular slope $m = -\frac{1}{2}$ and the given point $(x_1, y_1) = (2, -3)$.
* **Point-Slope Formula:** $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

    $$y - (-3) = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 2)$$
    $$y + 3 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 2)$$

---

#### 3. Convert to Standard Form ($Ax + By = C$)

**A. Eliminate the fraction:**
* Multiply every term by **2** to clear the denominator.
    $$2(y) + 2(3) = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(x - 2)$$
    $$2y + 6 = -1(x - 2)$$
    $$2y + 6 = -x + 2$$

**B. Rearrange to $Ax + By = C$ (ensure A is positive):**
* Move the $x$-term ($-x$) to the left side by adding $x$.
* Move the constant term ($6$) to the right side by subtracting $6$.
    $$x + 2y = 2 - 6$$
    $$\mathbf{x + 2y = -4}$$

---

**Final Equation in Standard Form:**
$$\mathbf{x + 2y = -4}$$

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=8h16m50s
- $ax + by < c$ : **Standard Form** this is a linear inequality, same as linear equalities just a different sign - 'a' 'b' and 'c' are real numbers, 'a' and 'b' are not BOTH zero 
- **Solution Region** = Any orderered pair (x, y) that satisfies the inequality
- **Non-Solution Region** = Any orderered pair (x, y) that do not satisfy the inequality
- **Boundary Line** = A line that seperates the solution region from the non-solution region
- **Strict Inequality** : '<' or '>' means that the boundary line is NOT part of the solution = **Dashed Line**
- **Non-Strict Inequality** : '$\ge$' or '$\le$' means that the boundary line IS part of the solution = **Solid Line**
- **Graphing a Linear Inequality in Two Variables** = Siimply Replace the inequality symbol with an equality symbol, then graph the resulting line (**Boundary Line**)
- 2 Ways to Solve/Graph :
	1) Test Point : (0,0) if the inequality holds true, shade everything in that region, if false, shade everything on the other side of the line : 2x + y < 3 : 0x + 0y < 3 : 0 < 3 : True : Shade everything on the side of the line with the test point, that is the solution region
	2) Solving for 'Y' : **Point Slope Form** : y < -2x + 3 : if you have a '<' 'less than' symbol, shade below the line, a '>' 'greater than' symbol, shade above (faster than using a testpoint)
	 - Note : You can use the test point in either the **Standard Form** or **Point Slope Form** and if the test point is true, it's within the solution region, false is outside.
- Special Case (Horizontal Line) : Y > 1 : Since x will always be zero, you get a horizontal line
- Special Case (Vertical Line) : X $\ge$ -3 : since y will always be zero, you get a vertical line 
- For solving **Compound Inequalities** example : x + y < 3 AND -3x + y $\ge$ -1 (completed below) you are solving to look for the intersection of the 2 solution sets, looking for the section of the coordinate plane that is the overlap, that satisfies **BOTH** inequalities - **TO Solve** : Solve each for 'Y' using **Point Slope Form** Then Graph each, and then look for overlap
- '**AND**' and '**OR**' the difference between these 2 keywords means : **AND** The solution is **BOTH** the inequalities. **OR** means the solution satisfies just one of the solution sets 
### Solving Linear Inequality: $5x - 3y \ge 15$

**Goal:** Isolate $y$ to convert the inequality into a graphable form ($y \le mx + b$ or $y \ge mx + b$).

**Inequality:**
$$5x - 3y \ge 15$$

---

#### 1. Isolate the $y$ term

*Subtract $5x$ from both sides:*
$$-3y \ge -5x + 15$$

#### 2. Solve for $y$

*Divide every term by $\mathbf{-3}$.*

$$\text{**CRITICAL STEP:** When multiplying or dividing an inequality 
by a negative number, you MUST **flip the inequality sign** ($\ge$ becomes $\le$).}$$

$$\frac{-3y}{-3} \le \frac{-5x}{-3} + \frac{15}{-3}$$

$$y \le \frac{5}{3}x - 5$$

---

#### 3. Final Solution (Graphing Form)

The solution to the inequality is:
$$\mathbf{y \le \frac{5}{3}x - 5}$$

**Interpretation for Graphing:**
* **Boundary Line:** The boundary line is $y = \frac{5}{3}x - 5$.
    * Slope ($m$): $\frac{5}{3}$
    * Y-intercept ($b$): $-5$
* **Line Type:** The $\le$ symbol means the line should be **solid** (to include points on the line).
* **Shading:** The $y \le \dots$ means you shade the region **below** the boundary line.
### Solving System of Linear Inequalities (x + y < 3 AND -3x + y $\ge$ -1) 

**Goal:** Graph the two inequalities to find the common shaded region.

**Inequalities:**
1.  $$x + y < 3$$
2.  $$-3x + y \ge -1$$

---

#### 1. Convert Inequality 1 to Graphing Form ($y = mx + b$)

$$x + y < 3$$
*Subtract $x$ from both sides:*
$$\mathbf{y < -x + 3}$$

* **Boundary Line:** $y = -x + 3$
* **Line Type:** **Dashed** (due to $<$ )
* **Shading:** **Below** the line (due to $<$ )

---

#### 2. Convert Inequality 2 to Graphing Form ($y = mx + b$)

$$-3x + y \ge -1$$
*Add $3x$ to both sides:*
$$\mathbf{y \ge 3x - 1}$$

* **Boundary Line:** $y = 3x - 1$
* **Line Type:** **Solid** (due to $\ge$ )
* **Shading:** **Above** the line (due to $\ge$ )

---

#### 3. Find the Point of Intersection (The Corner of the Solution Region)

The solution region is bounded by the intersection of the two boundary lines:
$$y = -x + 3$$
$$y = 3x - 1$$

* **Set equations equal:**
    $$-x + 3 = 3x - 1$$
* **Solve for x:**
    $$4 = 4x$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 1}$$
* **Solve for y (Substitute $x=1$):**
    $$y = -(1) + 3$$
    $$\mathbf{y = 2}$$

The boundary lines intersect at the point **(1, 2)**.

---

#### Solution Summary

The solution is the region that is **BELOW the line $y = -x + 3$** AND **ABOVE or ON the line $y = 3x - 1$**, with the corner point being **(1, 2)**.

- **Relation** = A set of ordered pairs - it is useful in mathematics to describe one quantity with it's RELATION to another
- All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.
- {(0, 0), (1, 12), (12 ,24), .. (0, 450)} : What a set of ordered pairs looks like aka a Relation
- **x** is the input variable and **y** is the output variable, the value of 'y' is dependant on the value of 'x'
- **Dependant Variable** = Dependant on another input variable for it's value (output variable, 'Y')
- **Independant Variable** = Not dependant on another variable (input varaible, 'X')
- **Domain** = **First Components** = A set of allowed values/inputs for the independant variable 'x' 
- **Range** = **Second Components** = A set of allowable values for your dependant variable 'y'
- **Function** = A special type of relation. Each member of the domain must correspond to EXACTLY ONE member of the range - Each 'x' value must link up to exactly one 'y' value -  IF YOU HAVE DUPLICATE "**X**" VALUES, IT IS NOT A FUNCTION, a 'Y' value can be linked to two different x values, only 'X' can't be duped - Each 'X' value can only be linked up to ONE unique 'Y' value - Different 'X' values CAN correspond to the same 'Y' value 
## Algebra II - Lesson 22 - More on Functions - 27October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=9h16m20s
- **Function** = A special type of relation. Each member of the domain must correspond to EXACTLY ONE member of the range - Each 'x' value must link up to exactly one 'y' value -  IF YOU HAVE DUPLICATE "**X**" VALUES, IT IS NOT A FUNCTION, a 'Y' value can be linked to two different x values, only 'X' can't be duped - Each 'X' value can only be linked up to ONE unique 'Y' value - Different 'X' values CAN correspond to the same 'Y' value 
- $y = 2x + 7$ : Domain = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ Range = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ : You can look at an equation and see if it's a function using the...
- **Vertical Line Test** = If a vertical line on a graph touches more than 1 point, it is not a function (because 'x' can not have 2 of the same values for a given 'x' value)
- Notes on finding the domains/ranges : You can't divide by zero, you can't take the square root of a negative number and get a real number, when we square a number the result is non-negative
- $y =6$ : technically, this is a function, because every 'x' value has only one 'y' value
- $\text{All Real Numbers: } \quad \left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ : All real numbers that can be used for the domain can be represented with $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$ 
- $y^2$ = x : This is not a function. 
- $\text{Domain= } \{x \mid x \ge 0\}$ or $[0, \infty)$. Range = $\left(-\infty, \infty\right)$
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ : This is not a function (It's a unit circle) (Example below) 
- The $\mathbf{\text{plus or minus}}$ ($\pm$) rule is used when solving an equation by taking the square root of a squared variable, ensuring you account for both the **positive** and **negative** roots, as both values squared yield the same result. (Example below)
- $y = \frac{1}{x}$ : This is a function. (also an asymptote) (Example Below)
### Domain and Range for the Circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$

**Description:** This equation defines a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.

---

#### 1. Domain (Possible x-values)

The circle extends from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$.

| Notation | Formula |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{x \mid -1 \le x \le 1\}}$$ |
| **Interval** | $$\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$$ |

---

#### 2. Range (Possible y-values)

The circle extends from $y = -1$ to $y = 1$.

| Notation        | Formula                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{y \mid -1 \le y \le 1\}}$$ |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{[-1, 1]}$$                   |
### 📝 The "Plus or Minus" Rule (Solving for $x^2$ or $y^2$)

**The Rule:** When solving an equation by taking the square root of a **squared variable** ($x^2$ or $y^2$), you must include the $\mathbf{\pm}$ sign on the opposite side of the equation.

**Example:**
If $$y^2 = 9$$
Then $$\sqrt{y^2} = \pm\sqrt{9}$$
$$\mathbf{y = \pm 3}$$

---

#### Why the $\pm$ is Necessary (The Two Solutions)

The $\pm$ sign reflects the fact that **two different numbers**, a positive one and a negative one, can be squared to yield the same positive result.

| Number | Squared Result |
| :---: | :---: |
| **3** | $(3)^2 = 9$ |
| **-3** | $(-3)^2 = 9$ |

Since the original equation ($y^2 = 9$) does not tell you whether $y$ was positive or negative before it was squared, you must account for **both possibilities** to capture all valid solutions. If you only wrote $y = 3$, you would lose the solution $y = -3$.

---

#### Key Distinction: Square Root Function vs. Solving an Equation

1.  **The Square Root Function ($\sqrt{x}$):**
    * The radical symbol ($\sqrt{ }$) *always* means the **principal (non-negative) square root**.
    * Example: $\sqrt{25}$ is only $\mathbf{5}$ (never $-5$).

2.  **Solving an Equation ($y^2 = 25$):**
    * You are performing an operation (taking the root) to **both sides** to find the unknown value $y$.
    * You are asking: "What number(s) squared equals 25?" The answer is **both** $5$ and $-5$. You introduce the $\pm$ to represent the two possible values of $y$.
### Domain and Range for the Reciprocal Function $y = \frac{1}{x}$ (Asymptote)

**Description:** This function creates a graph called a hyperbola, which has vertical and horizontal asymptotes at the axes.

---

#### 1. Domain (Possible x-values)

The domain is restricted because the denominator cannot be zero.

* **Restriction:** $x \neq 0$

| Notation        | Formula                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \neq 0\}}$$           |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)}$$ |

---

#### 2. Range (Possible y-values)

The range is restricted because the numerator (1) is never zero, so the fraction can never equal zero.

* **Restriction:** $y \neq 0$

| Notation        | Formula                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Set-Builder** | $$\mathbf{\{y \mid y \neq 0\}}$$           |
| **Interval**    | $$\mathbf{(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)}$$ |

## Algebra II - Lesson 23 - Function Notation - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=9h49m45s
- $y = x + 3$ is a function
- $y = x^2 - 5$ is a function
- eventually you move on from the above two examples where 'y'(dependant) gets it's value from 'x'(strong, independant) to 'f(x)' which does the same thing as 'y = x + c'
- **f, g, h** = functions are generally named with these letters **f(x), g(x), h(x)**
- **f(x)** = means a *function* of *x*
- $y = x^4 -3x + 7$ is the same thing as $f(x) = x^4 -3x + 7$ 
- $f(2)$ = simply means what is the value when the function is 2, just plug 2 in for x and solve.
- $f(a)$ = you can also use variables, doesn't change anything, just changing letter :
  $f(x) = 3x -1$ : $f(a) = 3a -1$   
- $f(a + 2)$ = 3(a + 2) - 1  : 
  f(a + 2) = 3a + 6 -1 : 3a +5 
- Squaring a binomial means multiplying it by itself $(z -1)^2$ isn't $(z^2 - 1^2)$ It's $(z-1)(z-1)$
- **Explicit Form** = A function is in explicit form when it is solved for the dependant variable: $y = f(x) = 3x - 5$ 
- **Implicit Form** = When the function is not solved for the dependant variable, we say it's in implicit form : $-5 = -3x + y$ 
- **Implicit Differentation** = It means that the function is NOT solved for 'y' - just solve for 'y' to get it back to **Explicit Form** then solve for $f(x)$ after 
- *()* = Use Parenthesis when substituting values, it will stop you from making mistakes
### 📝 Function Evaluation: $f(z - 1)$

**Given Function:**
$$f(x) = -5x^2 - 3x - 7$$

**Goal:** Evaluate $f(z - 1)$.

---

#### 1. Substitute $(z - 1)$ for $x$

$$f(z - 1) = -5(z - 1)^2 - 3(z - 1) - 7$$

---

#### 2. Expand the Squared Term

*Use the formula for squaring a binomial: $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$*
$$(z - 1)^2 = z^2 - 2(z)(1) + 1^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1$$

*Substitute this back into the expression:*
$$f(z - 1) = -5(z^2 - 2z + 1) - 3(z - 1) - 7$$

---

#### 3. Distribute the Coefficients

*Distribute $-5$ into the first parentheses.*
*Distribute $-3$ into the second parentheses.*

$$f(z - 1) = (-5z^2 + 10z - 5) + (-3z + 3) - 7$$

---

#### 4. Combine Like Terms

*Group terms by the power of z:*

$$\text{z}^2 \text{ terms: } \quad -5z^2$$
$$\text{z terms: } \quad 10z - 3z = 7z$$
$$\text{Constant terms: } \quad -5 + 3 - 7 = -2 - 7 = -9$$

---

#### 5. Final Simplified Function

*Combine the simplified terms:*

$$\mathbf{f(z - 1) = -5z^2 + 7z - 9}$$
### 📝 Explanation: Where Does -2z Come From in $(z - 1)^2$?

The error in thinking is often that $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - b^2$, but that is **INCORRECT**.

#### 1. The Correct Way to Square a Binomial

Squaring a binomial means multiplying it by itself:
$$(z - 1)^2 \quad \text{is the same as} \quad (z - 1)(z - 1)$$

#### 2. Using the FOIL Method

You must multiply every term in the first parentheses by every term in the second:

$$\mathbf{F} (\text{First}): \quad z \cdot z = z^2$$
$$\mathbf{O} (\text{Outer}): \quad z \cdot (-1) = -z$$
$$\mathbf{I} (\text{Inner}): \quad -1 \cdot z = -z$$
$$\mathbf{L} (\text{Last}): \quad -1 \cdot (-1) = +1$$

#### 3. Combining Like Terms

When you add the four resulting terms together, you get:
$$z^2 \quad \underbrace{-z - z}_{\text{These are the z-terms!}} \quad + 1$$

$$\mathbf{(z - 1)^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1}$$

---

#### Where your specific term comes from:

In your full problem, you had $-5$ multiplied by this result:
$$-5(z^2 - 2z + 1)$$

When you distribute the $-5$:
$$-5 \cdot z^2 = -5z^2$$
$$-5 \cdot (-2z) = \mathbf{+10z}$$
$$-5 \cdot (+1) = -5$$

So, the $\mathbf{-2z}$ is the middle term generated when you expand $(z-1)^2$ before the $-5$ is distributed.
### 📝 Implicit Function Evaluation

**Given Implicit Equation:**
$$x^4 - x^2 + 2y = 10$$

**Goal:** Find $f(0)$, $f(-2)$, and $f(5)$.

---

#### 1. Convert to Explicit Function $f(x)$

*Isolate $y$ by subtracting $x^4$ and $-x^2$ from both sides:*
$$2y = 10 - x^4 + x^2$$

*Divide every term by 2:*
$$y = \frac{10}{2} - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2}$$

**Explicit Function ($f(x)$):**
$$\mathbf{f(x) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}x^4 + \frac{1}{2}x^2}$$

---

#### 2. Evaluate $f(0)$

*Substitute $x = 0$ into the function:*
$$f(0) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2$$
$$f(0) = 5 - 0 + 0$$
$$\mathbf{f(0) = 5}$$

---

#### 3. Evaluate $f(-2)$

*Substitute $x = -2$ into the function:*
$$f(-2) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(-2)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(-2)^2$$
$$f(-2) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(16) + \frac{1}{2}(4)$$
$$f(-2) = 5 - 8 + 2$$
$$\mathbf{f(-2) = -1}$$

---

#### 4. Evaluate $f(5)$

*Substitute $x = 5$ into the function:*
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(5)^4 + \frac{1}{2}(5)^2$$
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}(625) + \frac{1}{2}(25)$$
$$f(5) = 5 - \frac{625}{2} + \frac{25}{2}$$

*Combine the fractions (common denominator of 2):*
$$f(5) = \frac{10}{2} - \frac{625}{2} + \frac{25}{2}$$
$$f(5) = \frac{10 - 625 + 25}{2}$$
$$f(5) = \frac{-590}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{f(5) = -295}$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 24 - Variation - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h13m
- **Direct Variation** : $y = kx$ : 'y' varies directly with(as) 'x' if there exists a real number 'k' such that $y = kx$ : to find 'k', simply divide 'y' by 'x'
- 'k' = ~~konstant~~ **Constant of Variation** = **Constant of Proportionality**(samething) =  doesn't change  - if 'k > 0' as 'x' increase, y increases - as 'x' decreases, 'y' decreases
- $y = 2x$ : this is a Direct Variation, if 'x' goes up, so does 'y'
- $y = mx + b$ : this is also a Direct Variation (if 'b' y intercept is 0 and slope is 2, literally the same as above)
- **Direct Variation as a Power** : $y = kx^n$ : y varies directly with the 'n'th power of x if there exists a real number 'k' such that : $y = kx^n$
- **Inverse Variation** : $\mathbf{y = \frac{k}{x}}$ : For inverse variation, 'y' depends on some constant value 'k', divided by 'x' - We can use our distance formula as an example. Think about using distance as a constant, time now varies inversely with the rate : $\mathbf{d = r t}$ : $\mathbf{r = \frac{d}{t}}$ : $\mathbf{t = \frac{d}{r}}$ - if you increase 'x', then 'y' will decrease, they are inversely related. 
- **Inverse Variation as a Power** : $\mathbf{y = \frac{k}{x^n}}$ : Same as above, just more power. (raised to a power on 'x' independant variable)
- **Joint Variation** : $y = kxz$ : This occurs with the product of two or more variables, sometimes raised to powers - same difficulty, just more tedious -  'y' varies directly from 'x' and 'z' if there is a constant 'k' such that $y = kxz$
- **Solving Variation Problems** :
  1) Start by finding the value for 'k'
  2) rewrite the equation with the known value for 'k'
  3) substitute what is give and solve
### 💰 Joint Variation Problem: Simple Interest
**Problem:** For a given principal, the amount of simple interest earned varies jointly with rate and time. If $9000 was earned after 6 years at 3% annual simple interest, how much would be earned after 10 years at 12% annual simple interest?

**Variation Model:**
$$\mathbf{I = Prt}$$$$\mathbf{I = krt}$$
*Where $I$ is Interest, $r$ is Rate, $t$ is Time, and $k$ is the constant (Principal).*

---

#### 1. Use the First Scenario to Find the Constant ($k$)

**Given:** $I_1 = \$9000$, $t_1 = 6$ years, $r_1 = 3\% = 0.03$.

*Substitute the values into the formula:*
$$9000 = k \cdot (0.03) \cdot (6)$$
$$9000 = k \cdot (0.18)$$

*Solve for the constant $k$ (the Principal):*
$$k = \frac{9000}{0.18}$$
$$\mathbf{k = 50,000}$$

*The constant of variation ($k$) is $\mathbf{\$50,000}$ (the principal amount).*

---

#### 2. Use the Constant ($k$) and the Second Scenario to Find the New Interest ($I_2$)

**Given:** $k = 50,000$, $t_2 = 10$ years, $r_2 = 12\% = 0.12$.

*Use the formula again with the new values:*
$$I_2 = k \cdot r_2 \cdot t_2$$
$$I_2 = 50000 \cdot (0.12) \cdot (10)$$

*Multiply the terms:*
$$I_2 = 50000 \cdot (1.20)$$
$$\mathbf{I_2 = 60,000}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

The amount that would be earned after 10 years at 12% annual simple interest is **\$60,000**.
### 🚗 Inverse Variation Problem: Speed and Time

**Problem:** Over a given distance, speed varies inversely with time. If a car travels a set distance in 10 hours going 110 mph, what speed is needed to go the same distance in 4 hours?

**Model:** Speed ($r$) varies inversely with Time ($t$).
$$\mathbf{rt = k} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{r_1 t_1 = r_2 t_2}$$
*(Where $k$ is the constant distance, $d$)*

---

#### 1. Use the First Scenario to Find the Constant ($k$)

**Given Scenario 1 ($r_1, t_1$):**
* Time ($t_1$): $10$ hours
* Speed ($r_1$): $110$ mph

*Calculate the constant $k$ (the distance):*
$$k = r_1 t_1$$
$$k = (110 \text{ mph}) \cdot (10 \text{ hours})$$
$$\mathbf{k = 1100} \quad \text{(miles)}$$

---

#### 2. Use the Constant ($k$) and the Second Scenario to Find the New Speed ($r_2$)

**Given Scenario 2 ($r_2, t_2$):**
* Distance ($k$): $1100$ miles
* Time ($t_2$): $4$ hours
* Speed ($r_2$): **Unknown**

*Use the formula to solve for $r_2$:*
$$r_2 t_2 = k$$
$$r_2 \cdot (4) = 1100$$
$$r_2 = \frac{1100}{4}$$
$$\mathbf{r_2 = 275}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

The speed needed to go the same distance in 4 hours is **275 mph**.
## Algebra II - Lesson 25 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Graphing - 28October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h35m20s
- The 'Answer' for systems of equations is the **Point of intersection** where both lines touch and satisfies both equations
- For systems of equations, you can test your ordered pair answer (x, y) by plugging in the values to BOTH linear equations and they should both give a true statement like '-3 = -3' or whatever
- **Special Case Scenarios** :
  1) No Solution : Parallel Lines (never touch - same slope) - The system is inconsistent 
  2) Infinite Number of Solutions : Same Line (always touch - same slope) - The equation is dependant
- One Solution = The two lines intersect at one and only one point - The system is consistent and the equations are independant
## Algebra II - Lesson 26 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Substitituion - 29October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=10h54m5s
- **Solving Linear Systems in two variables with Substitution** :
  1) Solve one of the equations for one of the variables
  2) Substitute for that variable in the other equation
- Substitution works best when you have a coefficient for one of the variables that is a '1' or '-1'
- You should use substitution when one of equations is in the form of 'y = ...' or 'x = ....' and you just need to plug in the known variable into the other equation, then solve for the other unknown (plug in x, solve for y with the new value(solution), find x after solving for 'y' - just typing that out sounds confusing, just be good at math, bro)
- Plug in for the known variable in either original equation, then solve for the other unknown
- the value you use to plug in will be part of the ordered pair, plug in '2' for 'x' and you solve for 'y' and find '7' giving you the ordered pair of (2, 7)
- Check the result : Plug in for 'x' and 'y' in both original equations and make sure that both sides of the equations are balanced '12 = 12' or whatever
### 💡 Solving System of Equations by Substitution (x+y = 5) (-2x -5y = 10)

**Given Equations:**

---

#### 2. Substitute the Expression into the Other Equation

*Substitute the expression for $\mathbf{x}$ (from Eq. 3) into Equation 2.*
$$-2x - 5y = -10$$
$$-2\mathbf{(5 - y)} - 5y = -10$$

---

#### 3. Solve the New Equation for $y$

**A. Distribute:**
$$-10 + 2y - 5y = -10$$

**B. Combine $y$ terms and Constants:**
$$-10 - 3y = -10$$

**C. Isolate $y$:**
*Add 10 to both sides:*
$$-3y = -10 + 10$$
$$-3y = 0$$
$$\mathbf{y = 0}$$

---

#### 4. Substitute $y$ Back to Find $x$

*Substitute $\mathbf{y = 0}$ back into the simplest equation, Equation 3:*
$$x = 5 - y$$
$$x = 5 - (0)$$
$$\mathbf{x = 5}$$

---

#### 5. Final Solution (Point of Intersection)

The solution is the ordered pair $\mathbf{(x, y)}$.
$$\mathbf{(5, 0)}$$

**Given Equations:**
1.  $$\mathbf{-3x + y = 9}$$
2.  $$\mathbf{-7x - 8y = -10}$$

## Algebra II - Lesson 27 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Elimination - 29October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=11h27m45s
- Use elimination when you have one pair of variable terms as opposites like (-5x, 5x) or (-10y, 10y)
- eliminate one of the variables from the system so you have a 1 variable equation that you can solve, which you can then plug back in to one of the original equations and solve for the other variable
- **Standard Form** : $ax + by = c$ : 'a', 'b', and 'c' are real numbers, and both 'a' and 'b' can not be 0
- **Solving Linear Systems in two Variables with Elimination** :
  1) place both equations in $ax + by = c$ : **Standard Form** 
  2) Transform one or both equations in a way that one pair on variable terms are opposites
  3) Add the left sides and set this equal to the sum of the right sides - you will have found the value of one the variables through this step
  4) Solve the resulting equation and find the other unknown using substitution
  5) Check the result: plug in 'x' and 'y' in both original equations - for you to have a solution for a system, it must work in both equations
- when you add the terms from the first equation to the second equation, technically, you are performing the same action on both sides, because $ax + by = c$  the '=' sign means you are adding the same thing to both sides
- When the variables are eliminated : the statement is true = infinitely many solutions - the statement is false = no solution

### 🧠 Solving a 3x3 System by Elimination ($-6x + 4y + z = 20$, $-2x - 6y - 5z = -22$, and $2x - 2y + 4z = 10$)

---

#### Step 1: Create a Simplified 2x2 System (Eliminate $x$)

**Pair A: Eliminate $x$ from Eq. 2 and Eq. 3**
*The $x$ coefficients ($-2x$ and $2x$) are already opposites.*
*Add the two equations directly:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} -2x - 6y - 5z &=& -22 \\ + \quad 2x - 2y + 4z &=& 10 \\ \hline 0x - 8y - z &=& -12 \end{array}$$

**Pair B: Eliminate $x$ from Eq. 1 and Eq. 3**
*Multiply Eq. 3 by $\mathbf{3}$ so the $x$ coefficients become opposites ($-6x$ and $6x$).*
$$3 \cdot (2x - 2y + 4z = 10) \quad \implies \quad 6x - 6y + 12z = 30$$

$$\begin{array}{rcl} -8y - z &=& -12 \\ + \quad 8y - 52z &=& -200 \\ \hline 0y - 53z &=& -212 \end{array}$$

*Solve for $z$:*
$$-53z = -212$$
$$z = \frac{-212}{-53}$$
$$\mathbf{z = 4}$$

---

#### Step 3: Back-Substitute to Find $y$

*Substitute $\mathbf{z = 4}$ into the simplest 2x2 equation (Eq. 4):*
$$-8y - z = -12$$
$$-8y - (4) = -12$$
$$-8y = -12 + 4$$

*Substitute $\mathbf{y = 1}$ and $\mathbf{z = 4}$ into the simplest original equation (Eq. 3):*
$$2x - 2y + 4z = 10$$
$$2x - 2(1) + 4(4) = 10$$
$$2x - 2 + 16 = 10$$
$$2x + 14 = 10$$
$$2x = 10 - 14$$

2.  $$-9x - 18y - 6z = -19$$
3.  $$-18x - 6y - 12z = 2$$

---

#### Step 2: Create a Simplified 2x2 System (Eliminate $y$)

**Pair A: Eliminate $y$ from Eq. 1 and Eq. 2**
*The $y$ coefficients ($18y$ and $-18y$) are already opposites.*
*Add the two equations directly:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} -3x + 18y - 12z &=& 19 \\ + \quad -9x - 18y - 6z &=& -19 \\ \hline -12x + 0y - 18z &=& 0 \end{array}$$
*Simplify by dividing by $-6$:*
$$\mathbf{2x + 3z = 0} \quad \text{(Eq. 4)}$$

**Pair B: Eliminate $y$ from Eq. 2 and Eq. 3**
*Multiply Eq. 3 by $\mathbf{-3}$ so the $y$ coefficients become opposites ($-18y$ and $18y$).*
$$-3 \cdot (-18x - 6y - 12z = 2) \quad \implies \quad 54x + 18y + 36z = -6$$
*Add the modified Eq. 3 and Eq. 2:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} -9x - 18y - 6z &=& -19 \\ + \quad 54x + 18y + 36z &=& -6 \\ \hline 45x + 0y + 30z &=& -25 \end{array}$$
*Simplify by dividing by $5$:*
$$\mathbf{9x + 6z = -5} \quad \text{(Eq. 5)}$$

---

#### Step 3: Solve the 2x2 System (Eq. 4 and Eq. 5)

*The new system is:*
4.  $$2x + 3z = 0$$
5.  $$9x + 6z = -5$$

*Eliminate $z$. Multiply Eq. 4 by $\mathbf{-2}$ to get $-6z$ (opposite of $6z$).*
$$-2 \cdot (2x + 3z = 0) \quad \implies \quad -4x - 6z = 0$$

*Add the modified Eq. 4 and Eq. 5:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} 9x + 6z &=& -5 \\ + \quad -4x - 6z &=& 0 \\ \hline 5x + 0z &=& -5 \end{array}$$

*Solve for $x$:*
$$5x = -5$$
$$\mathbf{x = -1}$$

---

#### Step 4: Back-Substitute to Find $z$

*Substitute $\mathbf{x = -1}$ into the simplest 2x2 equation (Eq. 4):*
$$2x + 3z = 0$$
$$2(-1) + 3z = 0$$
$$-2 + 3z = 0$$
$$3z = 2$$
$$\mathbf{z = \frac{2}{3}}$$

---

#### Step 5: Back-Substitute to Find $y$

*Substitute $\mathbf{x = -1}$ and $\mathbf{z = \frac{2}{3}}$ into the simplest original equation (Eq. 2, $-9x - 18y - 6z = -19$):*
$$-9(-1) - 18y - 6\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -19$$
$$9 - 18y - 4 = -19$$
$$5 - 18y = -19$$

*Isolate $y$:*
$$-18y = -19 - 5$$
$$-18y = -24$$
$$y = \frac{-24}{-18}$$
*Simplify the fraction (divide by 6):*
$$\mathbf{y = \frac{4}{3}}$$

---

#### Final Solution

The solution is the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$.
$$\mathbf{\left(-1, \frac{4}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right)}$$

**System:** (Eq 1: $-x + 4y - 6z = 4$, Eq 2: $-4x - 5z = 3$, Eq 3: $x + 6y + 2z = 12$)

**Goal:** Convert all to Standard Form ($\mathbf{Ax + By + Cz = D}$) and eliminate $y$.

---

#### Step 1: Convert to Standard Form

3.  $$6y + 2z = -x + 12 \quad \implies \quad \mathbf{x + 6y + 2z = 12} \quad \text{(Eq. 3')}$$

---

#### Step 2: Create a Simplified 2x2 System (Eliminate $y$)

*Since Eq. 2' already has $0y$, we only need to eliminate $y$ from Eq. 1' and Eq. 3'. The LCM of $4y$ and $6y$ is $12y$.*

**Eliminate $y$ from Eq. 1' and Eq. 3'**

*Multiply Eq. 1' by $\mathbf{3}$:*
$$3 \cdot (-x + 4y - 6z = 4) \quad \implies \quad -3x + 12y - 18z = 12$$

*Multiply Eq. 3' by $\mathbf{-2}$ to get $-12y$ (opposite of $12y$):*
$$-2 \cdot (x + 6y + 2z = 12) \quad \implies \quad -2x - 12y - 4z = -24$$

*Add the two modified equations:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} -3x + 12y - 18z &=& 12 \\ + \quad -2x - 12y - 4z &=& -24 \\ \hline -5x + 0y - 22z &=& -12 \end{array}$$

*The new system is:*
$$\text{2': } \quad \mathbf{-4x - 5z = 3}$$
$$\text{4: } \quad \mathbf{-5x - 22z = -12}$$

*Eliminate $x$. Multiply Eq. 2' by $\mathbf{5}$ and Eq. 4 by $\mathbf{-4}$ (LCM is $20$):*

$$5 \cdot (-4x - 5z = 3) \quad \implies \quad -20x - 25z = 15$$
$$-4 \cdot (-5x - 22z = -12) \quad \implies \quad 20x + 88z = 48$$

*Add the two modified equations:*
$$\begin{array}{rcl} -20x - 25z &=& 15 \\ + \quad 20x + 88z &=& 48 \\ \hline 0x + 63z &=& 63 \end{array}$$

*Solve for $z$:*
$$63z = 63$$
$$\mathbf{z = 1}$$

---

#### Step 4: Back-Substitute to Find $x$

*Substitute $\mathbf{z = 1}$ into the simplest 2x2 equation (Eq. 2'):*
$$-4x - 5z = 3$$
$$-4x - 5(1) = 3$$
$$-4x - 5 = 3$$
$$-4x = 8$$
$$\mathbf{x = -2}$$

---

#### Step 5: Back-Substitute to Find $y$

*Substitute $\mathbf{x = -2}$ and $\mathbf{z = 1}$ into the simplest original equation (Eq. 3'):*
$$x + 6y + 2z = 12$$
$$(-2) + 6y + 2(1) = 12$$
$$-2 + 6y + 2 = 12$$
$$6y = 12$$
$$\mathbf{y = 2}$$

## Algebra II - Lesson 29 - Applications of Linear Systems - 31October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=12h37m40s
- Word Problems : you have to dig through the information, and generate a problem, then solve it,  check it. instead of just doing with it as is given - It helps if you have a procedure to guide you through doing word problems.
- **Solving Applications of Linear Systems** :
  1) Read the problem and determine the main objective
  2) Assign a variable to represent each unknown.
  3) Write a system of equations
  4) Solve the system and check (you can't have -7 passengers, answer should be reasonable)
- If you have 3 unknown variables, you need 3 equations, if you have 2, you need 2. If you have 17 unknown variables, you need 17 equations... etc
### 🎭 Fall Musical Ticket Problem Solution (Substitution Method)

### 🌊 Boat and Current Problem Solution

A boat traveled 45 miles downstream and back. The trip downstream took 3 hours, while the trip back took 5 hours. Find the average speed of the boat in still water, along with the speed of the current.

#### 1. Variables and Equations
This problem uses the formula **Distance = Rate × Time ($d = rt$)**.

* Let **$x$** = Speed of the boat in still water (mph).
* Let **$y$** = Speed of the current (mph).

| Direction | Rate ($r$) | Time ($t$) | Distance ($d$) | Equation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Downstream** | $x + y$ | 3 hours | 45 miles | $3(x + y) = 45$ |
| **Upstream** | $x - y$ | 5 hours | 45 miles | $5(x - y) = 45$ |

#### 2. Simplified System of Equations
Divide by the time to simplify the rates:

* **Eq. 1 (Downstream):** $\frac{3(x + y)}{3} = \frac{45}{3} \implies \mathbf{x + y = 15}$
* **Eq. 2 (Upstream):** $\frac{5(x - y)}{5} = \frac{45}{5} \implies \mathbf{x - y = 9}$

#### 3. Solving for $x$ (Boat Speed)
Use the **Elimination Method** by adding the two simplified equations:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
(x + y) + (x - y) &=& 15 + 9 \\
2x &=& 24 \\
x &=& \frac{24}{2} \\
\mathbf{x} &=& \mathbf{12}
\end{array}
$$

#### 4. Solving for $y$ (Current Speed)
Substitute $x=12$ back into the simplified Equation 1:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
x + y &=& 15 \\
12 + y &=& 15 \\
y &=& 15 - 12 \\
\mathbf{y} &=& \mathbf{3}
\end{array}
$$

#### 5. Final Answer
* **Speed of the boat in still water ($x$):** **12 mph**
* **Speed of the current ($y$):** **3 mph**
### 💰 Investment Problem

#### Initial Problem
James won **$86,000** in the local lottery and invested the whole amount in three funds:
* **REIT** pays **6%** annual simple interest.
* **C.D.** pays **2%** annual simple interest.
* **Bond Fund** pays **3%** annual simple interest.

The total annual simple interest from the three investments was **$3,900**. The annual simple interest earned from the REIT was **$900 less than three times** the amount earned from the bond fund and the C.D. combined. Find how much was invested in each.

**I = Prt** : Interest = Principal * rate * time 

---

#### 1. Define Variables
Let $R$, $C$, and $B$ represent the amount (principal) invested in each fund:

* Let **$R$** = Amount invested in the **REIT** (6%).
* Let **$C$** = Amount invested in the **C.D.** (2%).
* Let **$B$** = Amount invested in the **Bond Fund** (3%).

The interest earned for each is $0.06R$, $0.02C$, and $0.03B$.

#### 2. Set Up the System of Equations

**Equation A (Total Principal):** The sum of the investments equals the total lottery winnings.
$$\mathbf{R + C + B = 86,000} \quad \text{(Eq. A)}$$

**Equation B (Total Interest):** The sum of the interest earned equals $3,900$.
$$\mathbf{0.06R + 0.02C + 0.03B = 3,900} \quad \text{(Eq. B)}$$

**Equation C (Interest Relationship):** The interest from the REIT ($0.06R$) is $900 less than three times the sum of the interest from the C.D. and the Bond Fund.
$$0.06R = 3(0.02C + 0.03B) - 900$$
$$\mathbf{0.06R = 0.06C + 0.09B - 900} \quad \text{(Eq. C)}$$

#### 3. Simplify and Solve

**Simplify Equation B:** Multiply by 100 to clear the decimals.
$$6R + 2C + 3B = 390,000 \quad \text{(Eq. 4)}$$

**Simplify Equation C:**
$$0.06R - 0.06C - 0.09B = -900$$
Multiply by 100 to clear the decimals.
$$6R - 6C - 9B = -90,000 \quad \text{(Eq. 5)}$$

**Combine Equations 4 and 5 (Eliminate $R$):** Subtract Eq. 5 from Eq. 4.
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
(6R + 2C + 3B) - (6R - 6C - 9B) &=& 390,000 - (-90,000) \\
6R - 6R + 2C - (-6C) + 3B - (-9B) &=& 390,000 + 90,000 \\
8C + 12B &=& 480,000
\end{array}
$$
Divide by 4 to simplify:
$$\mathbf{2C + 3B = 120,000} \quad \text{(Eq. 6)}$$

**Combine Equations A and 4 (Eliminate $R$):** Multiply Eq. A by 6 and subtract Eq. 4.
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
6(R + C + B) = 6(86,000) &\implies& 6R + 6C + 6B = 516,000 \\
(6R + 6C + 6B) - (6R + 2C + 3B) &=& 516,000 - 390,000 \\
4C + 3B &=& 126,000 \quad \text{(Eq. 7)}
\end{array}
$$

**Combine Equations 6 and 7 (Solve for $C$ and $B$):** Subtract Eq. 6 from Eq. 7.
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
(4C + 3B) - (2C + 3B) &=& 126,000 - 120,000 \\
2C &=& 6,000 \\
C &=& \frac{6,000}{2} \\
\mathbf{C} &=& \mathbf{3,000}
\end{array}
$$
Substitute $C=3,000$ into Eq. 6:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
2(3,000) + 3B &=& 120,000 \\
6,000 + 3B &=& 120,000 \\
3B &=& 114,000 \\
B &=& \frac{114,000}{3} \\
\mathbf{B} &=& \mathbf{38,000}
\end{array}
$$

**Solve for $R$:** Substitute $C=3,000$ and $B=38,000$ into Eq. A.
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
R + C + B &=& 86,000 \\
R + 3,000 + 38,000 &=& 86,000 \\
R + 41,000 &=& 86,000 \\
R &=& 86,000 - 41,000 \\
\mathbf{R} &=& \mathbf{45,000}
\end{array}
$$

#### 4. Final Investment Amounts

|        Fund         | Amount Invested |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: |
|   **REIT** ($R$)    |   **$45,000**   |
|   **C.D.** ($C$)    |   **$3,000**    |

## Algebra II - Lesson 30 - Solving Linear Systems in two Variables using Matrix Methods(Gaussian Elimination) - 02November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=13h17m30s
- **Matrix** = [ ] is an ordered array of numbers - a way to store numerical information
- **Rows** = Horizontal
- **Columns** = Vertical
- A matrix is named according to the number of rows and columns it contains : 3 rows by 4 columns would be a *3x4* matrix
- **Square Matrix** = has the same number of rows and columns
- **Augmented Matrix** = Takes a linear equation and turns it into a matrix array, only using the coefficients, example below :
- We can manipulate our matrix using row operations. These produce matrices that lead to linear systems with the same solution set as the original system. There are 3 types :
  1)  We can interchange any two rows
  2)  We can multiply any row by a non-zero number
  3)  We can multiply a row by a real number and add this to the corresponding elements of any other row (similar to using elimination method - multiply the ENTIRE ROW, not just parts)
- **Row Echelon Form** :  You want '1's going down the diagonal starting at top left, beneath the '1's put a zero, with real numbers above and to the side - If you know '0x 1y = c' you can just plug in for 'y' and find 'x'
  $$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & | & b \\
0 & 1 & | & c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
- **Reduced Row Echelon Form** :  You want '1's going down the diagonal starting at top left, the coefficients are going to be '0', and real numbers on the right side of the vertical bar - This will show the 'x' and 'y' intercepts, and already be solved - slightly faster than Row Echelon Form (REF) because you don't need to plug in values to find the solution
  $$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & | & a \\
0 & 1 & | & b
\end{bmatrix}

### 📝 Systems of Linear Equations to Augmented Matrix

This process is the **first step** in solving a system of linear equations using matrix methods (like Gaussian elimination).

---

#### **System of Equations**

The system must be in the standard form: $\mathbf{ax + by = c}$.

* **Example System:**
    * $2x - 5y = -14$
    * $7x - 7y = 14$

---

#### **Augmented Matrix Structure**

An **augmented matrix** combines the **coefficients** of the variables and the **constants**.

1.  **Coefficients:** The numbers multiplying the variables ($x$ and $y$).
2.  **Constants:** The numbers on the right side of the equals sign.

* A **vertical bar** ($|$) separates the coefficients from the constants.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{Coeff. } x & \text{Coeff. } y & \vdots & \text{Constant} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Conversion Steps**

1.  **Ensure Standard Form:** All equations must be $ax + by = c$.
2.  **Extract Row 1 (Eq. 1):** Take the coefficients and constant from the first equation.
    * $2x - 5y = -14 \rightarrow [2 \quad -5 \quad | \quad -14]$
3.  **Extract Row 2 (Eq. 2):** Take the coefficients and constant from the second equation.
    * $7x - 7y = 14 \rightarrow [7 \quad -7 \quad | \quad 14]$

---

#### **Final Augmented Matrix**

For the example system:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -5 & | & -14 \\
7 & -7 & | & 14
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* **Note:** Always include the **sign** of the coefficient. If a variable is missing, its coefficient is **0**.
### 📝 Solving System of Equations using Row Echelon Form (REF)

**Goal:** Transform the augmented matrix into **Row Echelon Form** (upper triangular with leading 1s) to solve for $x$ and $y$.

**Initial Augmented Matrix:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -5 & | & -14 \\
7 & -7 & | & 14
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 1: Get a leading 1 in $R_1$ (Row 1)**

**Operation:** $R_1 \leftarrow \frac{1}{2} R_1$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} & -5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} & | & -14 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
7 & -7 & | & 14
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \rightarrow \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & -\frac{5}{2} & | & -7 \\
7 & -7 & | & 14
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Get a 0 in $R_2, C_1$ (Row 2, Column 1)**

**Operation:** $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 7R_1$

* $R_2$ calculation:
    * $7 - 7(1) = \mathbf{0}$
    * $-7 - 7(-\frac{5}{2}) = -7 + \frac{35}{2} = \frac{-14}{2} + \frac{35}{2} = \mathbf{\frac{21}{2}}$
    * $14 - 7(-7) = 14 + 49 = \mathbf{63}$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\frac{5}{2} & | & -7 \\
\mathbf{0} & \frac{21}{2} & | & 63
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 3: Get a leading 1 in $R_2$**

**Operation:** $R_2 \leftarrow \frac{2}{21} R_2$

* $R_2$ calculation:

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\frac{5}{2} & | & -7 \\
0 & \mathbf{1} & | & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.

---

#### **Step 4: Back Substitution to Find Variables**

Convert the REF matrix back into linear equations:

1.  **Row 2:** $0x + 1y = 6 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{y = 6}$
2.  **Row 1:** $1x - \frac{5}{2}y = -7$

Substitute $y=6$ into the first equation:
$$
x - \frac{5}{2}(6) = -7
$$
$$
x - 15 = -7
$$
$$
x = -7 + 15
$$
$$
\mathbf{x = 8}
$$

---

### **✅ Solution**
$$
(x, y) = (8, 6)
$$
### 📝 Solving: $-9x - 9y = -27$ and $-5x - 4y = -20$ using Row Echelon Form: 

**Method:** Augmented Matrix to Row Echelon Form (REF)

#### **Step 1: Augmented Matrix Conversion**

The system of equations is converted by taking the coefficients and constants:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-9 & -9 & | & -27 \\
-5 & -4 & | & -20
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Achieve Row Echelon Form (REF)**

The goal is to get: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a & | & b \\ 0 & 1 & | & c \end{bmatrix}$

**2A. Get leading 1 in $R_1$**

**Operation:** $R_1 \leftarrow -\frac{1}{9} R_1$ (Divide $R_1$ by $-9$)

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & \mathbf{1} & | & \mathbf{3} \\
-5 & -4 & | & -20
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**2B. Get 0 in $R_2, C_1$**

* *Calculation:* $-5 + 5(1) = 0$; $-4 + 5(1) = 1$; $-20 + 5(3) = -5$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & | & 3 \\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{1} & | & \mathbf{-5}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.

---

#### **Step 3: Back Substitution**

Convert the REF matrix back to equations:

1.  **Row 2:** $0x + 1y = -5 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{y = -5}$
2.  **Row 1:** $x + y = 3$

Substitute $y = -5$ into the Row 1 equation:
$$
x + (-5) = 3
$$
$$
x = 3 + 5
$$
$$
\mathbf{x = 8}
$$

---

#### **✅ Solution**
$$
(x, y) = (8, -5)

### 📝 Solving: $5x - 6y = 24$ and $2x + 7y = -28$ Using Augmented Matrices, Row Echelon Form(REF), and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)

**Method:** Augmented Matrix to Row Echelon Form (REF) then Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)

---

#### **Step 1: Augmented Matrix Conversion**

The system of equations is converted into an augmented matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & -6 & | & 24 \\
2 & 7 & | & -28
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Achieve Row Echelon Form (REF)**

The goal for REF is: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a & | & b \\ 0 & 1 & | & c \end{bmatrix}$

**2A. Get leading 1 in $R_1$**

**Strategy:** Instead of directly multiplying by $\frac{1}{5}$ (which creates fractions immediately), let's swap rows or use a combination to get a smaller leading number if possible, or force a 1.
Let's try: $R_1 \leftarrow R_1 - 2R_2$
(This makes $5 - 2(2) = 1$, which is ideal!)

* *Calculation for $R_1$:*
    * $5 - 2(2) = \mathbf{1}$
    * $-6 - 2(7) = -6 - 14 = \mathbf{-20}$
    * $24 - 2(-28) = 24 + 56 = \mathbf{80}$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & \mathbf{-20} & | & \mathbf{80} \\
2 & 7 & | & -28
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**2B. Get 0 in $R_2, C_1$**

**Operation:** $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 2R_1$

* *Calculation for $R_2$:*
    * $2 - 2(1) = \mathbf{0}$
    * $7 - 2(-20) = 7 + 40 = \mathbf{47}$
    * $-28 - 2(80) = -28 - 160 = \mathbf{-188}$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -20 & | & 80 \\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{47} & | & \mathbf{-188}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**2C. Get leading 1 in $R_2$**

**Operation:** $R_2 \leftarrow \frac{1}{47} R_2$

* *Calculation for $R_2$:*
    * $47 \cdot \frac{1}{47} = \mathbf{1}$
    * $-188 \cdot \frac{1}{47} = \mathbf{-4}$ (Since $47 \times 4 = 188$)

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -20 & | & 80 \\
0 & \mathbf{1} & | & \mathbf{-4}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.

---

#### **Step 3: Achieve Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**

The goal for RREF is: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & | & x \\ 0 & 1 & | & y \end{bmatrix}$

**3A. Get 0 in $R_1, C_2$**

We need to make the '$-20$' in $R_1$ a '0' using $R_2$ (which has the leading 1 in $C_2$).

**Operation:** $R_1 \leftarrow R_1 + 20R_2$

* *Calculation for $R_1$:*
    * $1 + 20(0) = \mathbf{1}$
    * $-20 + 20(1) = \mathbf{0}$
    * $80 + 20(-4) = 80 - 80 = \mathbf{0}$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} & | & \mathbf{0} \\
0 & 1 & | & -4
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**.

---

#### **Step 4: Extract Solution from RREF**

Convert the RREF matrix back to equations:

1.  **Row 1:** $1x + 0y = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{x = 0}$
2.  **Row 2:** $0x + 1y = -4 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{y = -4}$

---

#### **✅ Solution**
$$
(x, y) = (0, -4)

## Algebra II - Lesson 31 - Solving Linear Systems in three Variables using Matrix Methods (Augmented Matrices, Row Echelon Form, Gaussian Elimination) - 03November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=13h50m
- **Matrix Methods** = Allow you to solve very large matrix systems very quickly using a computer
**1. Row Echelon Form (REF)**

A matrix is in REF if it satisfies the following three conditions:
* Any rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.
* The **leading entry** (first non-zero number) in each non-zero row is a **1** (called the **leading 1** or **pivot**).
* Each leading 1 is to the right of the leading 1 in the row immediately above it.

* **Visual Structure:**
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{1} & a & b & | & c \\
    0 & \mathbf{1} & d & | & e \\
    0 & 0 & \mathbf{1} & | & f
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

**2. Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**

A matrix is in RREF if it satisfies the conditions for REF **PLUS** the following condition:
* Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else. (All entries *above* and *below* the leading 1 must be zero).

* **Visual Structure:**
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{1} & 0 & 0 & | & c \\
    0 & \mathbf{1} & 0 & | & e \\
    0 & 0 & \mathbf{1} & | & f
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
- We can manipulate our matrix using row operations. These produce matrices that lead to linear systems with the same solution set as the original system. There are 3 types :
  1)  We can interchange any two rows
  2)  We can multiply any row by a non-zero number
  3)  We can multiply a row by a real number and add this to the corresponding elements of any other row (similar to using elimination method - multiply the ENTIRE ROW, not just parts)
- After getting the first column of (1, 0, 0) going down, it's easier to start on the next diagonal '1' on row 2 than it is to get the next '0' on row 1, because once you have a '1' on row 2 you can use it to cancel out the other variables on the 2nd column.... that's confusing AF typing it, no way I'm going to remember that. **Future Sean After gettting (1,0,0) on the first column, go for row 2's column 2 and make it '1' instead of clearing row 1 column 2 to '0', do that after - CLEAR THE DIAGONAL '1's FIRST THEN USE THE '1's TO CLEAR THE REST OF THE COLUMNS**

$$

This is the **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.

---

#### **Step 3: Achieve Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**

The goal is to eliminate all non-zero entries *above* the leading 1s.

**3A. Eliminate entries above $R_3$'s leading 1**

\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**.

---

#### **Step 4: Extract Solution from RREF**

Convert the RREF matrix back to equations:

* $1x + 0y + 0z = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{x = 0}$
* $0x + 1y + 0z = -5 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{y = -5}$
* $0x + 0y + 1z = -1 \quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf{z = -1}$

**Final Solution:**
$$
(x, y, z) = (0, -5, -1)
$$
### 📝 Solving System with Infinite or No Solutions (RREF Method)

* $E_2$: $-3x - 3y - 2z = 0$
* $E_3$: $-x - y - 3z = 26$

-4 & -4 & -4 & | & 12 \\
-3 & -3 & -2 & | & 0 \\
-1 & -1 & -3 & | & 26
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Achieve Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**

**2A. Get leading 1 in $R_1, C_1$**

**Operation:** $R_1 \leftarrow -\frac{1}{4} R_1$ (Simplify $R_1$)
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{1} & \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{1} & | & \mathbf{-3} \\
-3 & -3 & -2 & | & 0 \\
-1 & -1 & -3 & | & 26
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**2B. Get 0s below $R_1$'s leading 1**

**Operations:**
* $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 + 3R_1$
* $R_3 \leftarrow R_3 + 1R_1$

* *Notice $C_2$ and $C_1$ are identical, indicating a **free variable** ($y$).*

| Row | x | y | z | Constant |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $R_2$ new: | $-3+3(1)=\mathbf{0}$ | $-3+3(1)=\mathbf{0}$ | $-2+3(1)=\mathbf{1}$ | $0+3(-3)=\mathbf{-9}$ |
| $R_3$ new: | $-1+1(1)=\mathbf{0}$ | $-1+1(1)=\mathbf{0}$ | $-3+1(1)=\mathbf{-2}$ | $26+1(-3)=\mathbf{23}$ |

$$
\begin{bmatrix}

0 & 0 & 1 & | & -9 \\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & | & \mathbf{5}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Interpretation of Final Row:** The third row states $0x + 0y + 0z = 5$, or $0 = 5$. This is a **false statement**. - Row 3 states : '0x' + '0y' + '0z' = 5 : which is impossible, so the statement is false

---

#### **Step 3: Conclusion from RREF**

When the RREF process yields a row of all zeros to the left of the augmentation bar, but a non-zero number to the right (e.g., $[0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \mid 5]$), the system is **inconsistent**.

**Final Result:** There is **no solution** to this system of linear equations.

---

#### **✅ Solution**
The system is **inconsistent**. No solution exists.

## Algebra II - Lesson 32 - Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities(Graphing Systems of Inequalities) - 03November2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=14h25m55s
- For systems of INEQUALITIES (greater than/less than) the solution is where the 2 areas overlap and the plane that satisfies both inequalities
- I've already done this stuff already, dashed lines for (< >) greater than / less than - shade above for greater than, shade below for less than - solid line for greater than equal to / less than equal to
- When you multiply or divide by a negative you need to flip the direction of the inequality
- Not gonna do all the problems for this, I already know this stuff
## Algebra II - Lesson 33 - Review The Rules of Exponents - 04November2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=14h39m50s
- **Product Rule for exponents** : $\mathbf{x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}}$ : multiplying 2 exponents with the same base(d) means you add the exponents together
- **Power of Zero** : $x^0 = 1$ :  Anything raised to the '0'th power is 1 (there's some deep platonic lore here : A110ne = m0nad)
- **Negative Exponents** : $\mathbf{x^{-m} = \frac{1}{x^m}}$  : **Rule:** Any non-zero base ($x$) raised to a negative exponent ($-m$) is equal to the reciprocal of that base raised to the **positive** exponent ($m$).
- **Inverse Negative Exponents** : $$
    \frac{1}{x^{-m}} = x^m
    $$
- **Negative Exponents in Fractions** : $$
    \mathbf{\frac{x^{-m}}{y^{-n}} = \frac{y^n}{x^m}}
    $$
    * **Rule:** A base with a negative exponent in the **numerator** moves to the **denominator** and the exponent becomes positive. A base with a negative exponent in the **denominator** moves to the **numerator** and the exponent becomes positive.
    * **Condition:** Neither $x$ nor $y$ can be zero.
- **Quotient Rule for Exponents (Division Rule)** : $\mathbf{\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}}$ : When dividing two exponential expressions that have the **same base**, you **subtract** the exponent of the denominator ($n$) from the exponent of the numerator ($m$).
- **Power of a Power Rule** : $\mathbf{(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}}$ : This rule states that when you raise a power to another power, you **multiply** the exponents
- **Power of a Product Rule** : $\mathbf{(ab)^m = a^m b^m}$ : This rule states that when a product is raised to an exponent, you apply the exponent to **each factor** inside the parentheses.
- **Power of a Quotient Rule** : $\mathbf{\left[\frac{a}{b}\right]^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m}}$ : This rule states that when a quotient (fraction) is raised to an exponent, you apply the exponent to both the **numerator** and the **denominator**.
- When doing something like $(6xy)^4$ don't forget to raise the coefficient(6) to the power as well
- Also remember that ' $-2y^2 * -x^-2y^6$ '  '-x' is the same as '-1 * x' and the negative symbol on the coefficients will cancel out (-2 * -1 = 2)
### 📝 Exponents and Negative Bases

#### **The Rule**

The sign of the result depends entirely on whether the exponent is **even** or **odd**.

* **Even Exponent:** If the exponent ($n$) is even, the result is always **positive**.
* **Odd Exponent:** If the exponent ($n$) is odd, the result is always **negative** (matching the original base's sign).

---

#### **Examples**

| Expression | Calculation | Result | Sign |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $(-2)^2$ | $(-2) \times (-2)$ | **4** | Positive (Even Power) |
| $(-2)^3$ | $(-2) \times (-2) \times (-2)$ | **-8** | Negative (Odd Power) |
| $(-3)^4$ | $(-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) \times (-3)$ | **81** | Positive (Even Power) |

---

#### **Sentence Summary**

When a negative base is multiplied by itself an **even** number of times, the negative signs cancel out in pairs, yielding a **positive** result; when multiplied an **odd** number of times, one negative sign is left over, making the result **negative**.
### 📝 Solving $(6xy)^4$ using the Power of a Product Rule

**Goal:** Simplify the expression $(6xy)^4$ by applying the exponent to every factor inside the parentheses.

---

#### **Rule Applied**

This expression uses the **Power of a Product Rule**:
$$
\mathbf{(ab)^m = a^m b^m}
$$
In this case, the base being raised to the power of 4 has **three factors**:
* $a = 6$ (a constant)
* $b = x$ (a variable)
* $c = y$ (a variable)

The rule extends to three factors: $\mathbf{(abc)^m = a^m b^m c^m}$.

---

#### **Solution Steps**

1.  **Identify Factors and Exponent:**
    * Factors: $6$, $x$, $y$
    * Outer Exponent: 4

2.  **Apply Exponent to Each Factor:**
    $$
    (6xy)^4 = 6^4 \cdot x^4 \cdot y^4
    $$

3.  **Calculate the Constant Factor:**
    * $6^4 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6$
    * $6^2 = 36$
    * $36 \times 36 = 1296$

4.  **Final Simplified Expression:**
    $$
    (6xy)^4 = \mathbf{1296x^4y^4}
    $$

- **Polynomial** = is either a single term or a finite sum of terms where all variables have whole number exponents and there are no variables in any denominator
- **Standard Form** = A Polynomial is written in standard form when the powers/exponents are in descending order 
- **Degree of the Term** = The degree of a term in a polynomial is the sum of the exponents on the variables of the term 
- $3x^7y^5$ : would be '7 + 5' = 12th degree for the term
- **The Degree of the Polynomial** = The greatest degree of any term in the polynomial is known as the degree of the polynomial
- $4x^5 + 2x^3 - 7$ : the degree of the polynomial would be '5'
- $-x^7y^3 + 7x^9y^5 - 3xy + 8$ : '9 + 5' the degree of the polynomial would be '14'
- Adding and subtracting polynomials = simply combine like terms (same power/exponent)
- $(5m^3 - 6m^2 + 8m) - (3m^3 + 5m^2)$ : don't forget to distribute the '-' negative sign to all terms in the parenthesis '$+ (-1)(3m^3 +5m^2)$' multiply it by '-1' so you remember

- When we multiply 2 polynomials together, we use our distributive property(multiply everything in the parenthesis by everything outside the parenthesis - coefficients, variables and exponents)
- **FOIL** = When multiplying 2 binomials, First, Outer, Inner, Last - when multiplying 2 binomials, you have to multiply EACH TERM - then combine like terms
- We can multiply more than two polynomials by multiplying pairs of polynomials until we have our product see '$7b(6b + 3)(3b - 3)$' below

### 📝 Multiplying Trinomials: $(7x^2 + 8x + 2)(8x^2 + 6x + 5)$

#### **Step 1: Distribute Each Term**

Multiply each term from the first trinomial by every term in the second trinomial.

**1. Distribute $7x^2$:**
* $7x^2 \cdot 8x^2 = 56x^4$
* $7x^2 \cdot 6x = 42x^3$
* $7x^2 \cdot 5 = 35x^2$
**(Result 1: $56x^4 + 42x^3 + 35x^2$)**

**2. Distribute $8x$:**
* $8x \cdot 8x^2 = 64x^3$
* $8x \cdot 6x = 48x^2$
* $8x \cdot 5 = 40x$
**(Result 2: $64x^3 + 48x^2 + 40x$)**

**3. Distribute $2$:**
* $2 \cdot 8x^2 = 16x^2$
* $2 \cdot 6x = 12x$
* $2 \cdot 5 = 10$
**(Result 3: $16x^2 + 12x + 10$)**

---

#### **Step 2: Combine Like Terms**

Sum all the results from Step 1, grouping terms by their exponent (degree):

$$
(56x^4 + 42x^3 + 35x^2) + (64x^3 + 48x^2 + 40x) + (16x^2 + 12x + 10)
$$

* **$x^4$ terms:** $56x^4$
* **$x^3$ terms:** $42x^3 + 64x^3 = \mathbf{106x^3}$
* **$x^2$ terms:** $35x^2 + 48x^2 + 16x^2 = 99x^2$
* **$x^1$ terms:** $40x + 12x = \mathbf{52x}$
* **Constant terms:** $10$

---

#### **Step 3: Final Simplified Result**

Write the combined expression in descending order of power.

$$
\mathbf{56x^4 + 106x^3 + 99x^2 + 52x + 10}
$$
### 📝 Multiplying Trinomials ($\mathbf{7b(6b + 3)(3b - 3)}$)

**Expression:**
$$
\mathbf{7b(6b + 3)(3b - 3)}
$$

---

#### **Step 1: Multiply the Binomials (FOIL)**

Multiply $(6b + 3)$ by $(3b - 3)$ first.

1.  **First:** $(6b) \cdot (3b) = 18b^2$
2.  **Outer:** $(6b) \cdot (-3) = -18b$
3.  **Inner:** $(3) \cdot (3b) = +9b$
4.  **Last:** $(3) \cdot (-3) = -9$

**Combine Like Terms:** $-18b + 9b = -9b$

$$
(6b + 3)(3b - 3) = \mathbf{18b^2 - 9b - 9}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Distribute the Monomial**

Multiply the result from Step 1 by the monomial $7b$.

$$
7b \cdot (18b^2 - 9b - 9)
$$

1.  $7b \cdot 18b^2 = (7 \cdot 18)b^{1+2} = \mathbf{126b^3}$
2.  $7b \cdot (-9b) = (7 \cdot -9)b^{1+1} = \mathbf{-63b^2}$
3.  $7b \cdot (-9) = (7 \cdot -9)b = \mathbf{-63b}$

---

#### **Step 3: Final Expanded Result**

The fully expanded polynomial is:

$$
\mathbf{126b^3 - 63b^2 - 63b}
$$

**(Note: This result is identical to the one obtained by simplifying first, confirming the algebra is correct.)**

### 📝 Multiplying Three Binomials: $(3x + 2y)(4x - 4y)(6x - 1)$

**Goal:** Expand the expression by multiplying the first two binomials, and then multiplying the resulting trinomial by the third binomial.

---

#### **Step 1: Multiply the First Two Binomials (FOIL)**

Multiply $(3x + 2y)$ by $(4x - 4y)$.

1.  **First:** $(3x)(4x) = 12x^2$
2.  **Outer:** $(3x)(-4y) = -12xy$
3.  **Inner:** $(2y)(4x) = +8xy$
4.  **Last:** $(2y)(-4y) = -8y^2$

**Combine Like Terms:** $-12xy + 8xy = -4xy$

$$
(3x + 2y)(4x - 4y) = \mathbf{12x^2 - 4xy - 8y^2}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Multiply the Resulting Trinomial by the Third Binomial**

Multiply $(12x^2 - 4xy - 8y^2)$ by $(6x - 1)$. We must distribute both $6x$ and $-1$ across the trinomial.

**A. Distribute $6x$:**
* $6x \cdot 12x^2 = 72x^3$
* $6x \cdot (-4xy) = -24x^2y$
* $6x \cdot (-8y^2) = -48xy^2$

**B. Distribute $-1$:**
* $-1 \cdot 12x^2 = -12x^2$
* $-1 \cdot (-4xy) = +4xy$
* $-1 \cdot (-8y^2) = +8y^2$

---

#### **Step 3: Combine Like Terms**

Sum the results from Step 2A and 2B. Arrange terms by degree and alphabetical order within degrees:

* **$x^3$ terms:** $72x^3$
* **$x^2$ terms:** $-12x^2$
* **$x^2y$ terms:** $-24x^2y$
* **$xy^2$ terms:** $-48xy^2$
* **$xy$ terms:** $+4xy$
* **$y^2$ terms:** $+8y^2$

**(Note: There are no exact like terms to combine in this specific set of results.)**

---

#### **Step 4: Final Expanded Result**

The fully expanded polynomial is:

$$
\mathbf{72x^3 - 24x^2y - 12x^2 - 48xy^2 + 4xy + 8y^2}
$$

*(If you were to simplify by factoring $4x-4y=4(x-y)$ first, the final answer would look algebraically different but would be equivalent.)*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=1637m5s
- **DMSBR** = Divivde, Multiply, Subtract, Bringdown, Repeat/Remainder = Family Mnemonic : Dad, Mom, Sister, Brother, Rover = Used in long division
- For doing long division on polynomials, you want to put the polynomial in standard form first, then leading terms go with leading terms (example below - 'n' is the leading term, so you divide by that first on the leading term, get the amount '$5n^3 / n = 5n^2$ and THEN multiply that by the divisor terms, subtract the new multiplied term by the next term(bringdown), take the remainder, and repeat.. )
- when converting a polynomial to standard form and you have missing terms, use '0' zero as a placeholder - YOU NEED TO DO THIS FOR BOTH THE NUMERATOR (TOP) and DENOMINATOR (bottom), convert BOTH to standard forms, and if a term is missing replace it with '0' like the example below using $0x^2$ and $0x$  as placeholder
- if you want to check your result, just multiply the quotient by ther divisor and add the remainder
### 📝 Polynomial Long Division

**Problem:** Divide $45n + 5n^3 - 18 + 38n^2$ by $n + 6$.

#### **Step 1: Rewrite Dividend in Standard Form**

The dividend (numerator) must be arranged in descending order of powers:
$$
\text{Dividend} = 5n^3 + 38n^2 + 45n - 18
$$
The divisor (denominator) is $n + 6$.

---

#### **Step 2: Perform Long Division**

**A. Find the first term of the quotient:**
* Divide the first term of the dividend ($5n^3$) by the first term of the divisor ($n$).
    $$
    \frac{5n^3}{n} = \mathbf{5n^2}
    $$
* Multiply $5n^2$ by the divisor ($n + 6$): $5n^2(n + 6) = 5n^3 + 30n^2$
* Subtract this result from the dividend:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=17h6m25s
- When we didvide a polynomial by a binomial of the form $x - k$, we can use a shortcut known as synthetic division
- You want to write the polynomial in standard form and replace any missing terms with '$0x^n$', then get the constant, which is 'k' 
- x + 3 = x - (-3) : if you write it like this and ignore the first '-' sign, you can just take '-3' and that would be 'k'
- similar to matrices, you just use the coefficients and leave the variables/exponents out
- if you have a '0' in the final positon, that means you have no remainder

- $f(x) = -x^3 + 5x - 10$ : find: f(0), f(2), f(-2) : how a function looks, replace 'x' with the value you are solving for
- **Adding a Function** : $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ : take 'f(x)' and add it with 'g(x)' combining like terms
- **Subtracting a Function** : $(f- g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ : when subtracting, make sure you put  all the terms in a parenthesis, so you don't just subtract the first term
- If you are given the term for 'x' like : $(f + g)(2)$ : simply plug '2' in for 'x' and sum the 2 
- '$11(2)^4$' when multiplying something like this, multiply the *exponent first* 
- **Multiply a Function** : $(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)$ : same concept, just plug in for the 'x'  values and multiply

3.  **$x$ Terms:** $11x - 5x = \mathbf{+6x}$
4.  **Constant Term:** $-3$

$$
(f + g)(x) = \mathbf{11x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x - 3}

Substitute $x=2$ into the resulting sum function $(f + g)(x)$.

$$
(f + g)(2) = 11(2)^4 - 8(2)^3 + 6(2) - 3
$$

1.  **Calculate Powers:**
    * $2^4 = 16$
    * $2^3 = 8$
    $$
    (f + g)(2) = 11(16) - 8(8) + 6(2) - 3
    $$

2.  **Multiply:**
    $$
    (f + g)(2) = 176 - 64 + 12 - 3
    $$

3.  **Final Calculation:**
    $$
    (f + g)(2) = 112 + 12 - 3
    $$
    $$
    (f + g)(2) = 124 - 3 = \mathbf{121}

* $g(x) = 14x^3 - 12x^2$
* $h(x) = 7x^2 - 11x$

---

#### **Step 1: Find the Sum Function, $(f + g + h)(x)$**

Combine the three functions by grouping and adding like terms. First, ensure all terms are arranged in descending order of power.

$$
(f + g + h)(x) = (5x^2 + 14x + 12) + (14x^3 - 12x^2) + (7x^2 - 11x)
$$

1.  **$x^3$ Terms:** $14x^3$
2.  **$x^2$ Terms:** $5x^2 - 12x^2 + 7x^2 = (5 - 12 + 7)x^2 = \mathbf{0x^2}$
3.  **$x$ Terms:** $14x - 11x = \mathbf{+3x}$
4.  **Constant Terms:** $+12$

$$
(f + g + h)(x) = \mathbf{14x^3 + 3x + 12}
$$

---

#### **Step 2: Evaluate the Sum Function at $x=-1$**

Substitute $x=-1$ into the resulting sum function $(f + g + h)(x)$.

$$
(f + g + h)(-1) = 14(-1)^3 + 3(-1) + 12
$$

1.  **Calculate Powers:**
    * $(-1)^3 = -1$ (Negative base raised to an odd power is negative.)
    $$
    (f + g + h)(-1) = 14(-1) + 3(-1) + 12
    $$

2.  **Multiply:**
    $$
    (f + g + h)(-1) = -14 - 3 + 12
    $$

3.  **Final Calculation:**
    $$
    (f + g + h)(-1) = -17 + 12 = \mathbf{-5}

* $g(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 6$

---

#### **Method 1: Multiply First, Then Evaluate**

**Step 1a: Find the Product Function, $(f \cdot g)(x)$**
Multiply $f(x)$ by $g(x)$ using the distributive property.

$$
(f \cdot g)(x) = (2x + 5)(3x^2 + 4x - 6)
$$
Distribute $2x$: $2x(3x^2) + 2x(4x) + 2x(-6) = 6x^3 + 8x^2 - 12x$
Distribute $5$: $5(3x^2) + 5(4x) + 5(-6) = 15x^2 + 20x - 30$

**Combine Like Terms:**
$$
(f \cdot g)(x) = 6x^3 + (8x^2 + 15x^2) + (-12x + 20x) - 30
$$
$$
(f \cdot g)(x) = 6x^3 + 23x^2 + 8x - 30
$$

**Step 1b: Evaluate the Product Function at $x=-1$**
Substitute $x=-1$ into the result.
$$
(f \cdot g)(-1) = 6(-1)^3 + 23(-1)^2 + 8(-1) - 30
$$
$$
(f \cdot g)(-1) = 6(-1) + 23(1) - 8 - 30
$$
$$
(f \cdot g)(-1) = -6 + 23 - 8 - 30
$$
$$
(f \cdot g)(-1) = 17 - 8 - 30 = 9 - 30 = \mathbf{-21}
$$

---

#### **Method 2: Evaluate First, Then Multiply (Easier)**

**Step 2a: Evaluate $f(-1)$ and $g(-1)$ Separately**
$$
f(-1) = 2(-1) + 5 = -2 + 5 = \mathbf{3}
$$
$$
g(-1) = 3(-1)^2 + 4(-1) - 6 = 3(1) - 4 - 6 = 3 - 10 = \mathbf{-7}
$$

**Step 2b: Multiply the Results**
$$
(f \cdot g)(-1) = f(-1) \cdot g(-1) = 3 \cdot (-7) = \mathbf{-21}
$$

---

#### **Final Result**

$$
\mathbf{(f \cdot g)(-1) = -21}
$$

* $f(x) = x^3 + 7x^2 - 9x - 4$
* $g(x) = x + 8$

**Goal:** Calculate $(f/g)(-4)$, which is equal to $\frac{f(-4)}{g(-4)}$.

---

#### **Step 1: Evaluate $f(x)$ at $x=-4$**

Substitute $x=-4$ into $f(x)$.

$$
f(-4) = (-4)^3 + 7(-4)^2 - 9(-4) - 4
$$

1.  **Calculate Powers:**
    * $(-4)^3 = -64$
    * $(-4)^2 = 16$
    $$
    f(-4) = -64 + 7(16) - 9(-4) - 4
    $$

2.  **Multiply:**
    $$
    f(-4) = -64 + 112 + 36 - 4
    $$

3.  **Final Sum:**
    $$
    f(-4) = 48 + 36 - 4 = 84 - 4 = \mathbf{80}
    $$

---

#### **Step 2: Evaluate $g(x)$ at $x=-4$**

Substitute $x=-4$ into $g(x)$.

$$
g(-4) = -4 + 8 = \mathbf{4}
$$

---

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Quotient**

Divide the result from Step 1 by the result from Step 2.

$$
(f/g)(-4) = \frac{f(-4)}{g(-4)} = \frac{80}{4} = \mathbf{20}
$$

---

#### **Final Result**

$$
\mathbf{(f/g)(-4) = 20}

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=17h57m50s
- **GCF = Greatest Common Factor** = The greatest common factor is the largest term that each term of the polynomial is divisible by
- $6x^2, 12x, 18x^5$ : GCF would by $6x$ 
- Do prime factorization (break it down) and the GCF will be the numbers from the factorization that are shared between each term, then multiply them together to get the GCF
- If it's not common to everything, it can't be a part of the GCF : 'y' not example below
- Factoring is just reversing the distributive property
- if all the terms are '-' negative, you can factor the negative symbol as well
### 📝 Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

**Expressions:**
$$
\mathbf{14y^2x, \quad 21x^3y^2, \quad 42x^9y^3}
$$

---

#### **Step 1: Find the GCF of the Coefficients**

Determine the largest number that divides evenly into the coefficients (14, 21, and 42).

* **Prime Factors:**
    * $14 = 2 \cdot 7$
    * $21 = 3 \cdot 7$
    * $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$

* **Coefficient GCF:** The common factor is **7**.

---

#### **Step 2: Find the GCF of the Variable Terms**

For each variable, the GCF is the lowest power present across all terms.

| Variable | Powers Present | Lowest Power (GCF) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $x$ | $x^1, x^3, x^9$ | $\mathbf{x^1}$ |
| $y$ | $y^2, y^2, y^3$ | $\mathbf{y^2}$ |

---

#### **Step 3: Combine the Results**

Multiply the GCFs of the coefficients and the variables.

$$
\text{GCF} = (7) \cdot (x) \cdot (y^2)
$$

---

#### **Final Result**

$$
\mathbf{GCF = 7xy^2}

### 📝 Factoring a Polynomial by GCF (Negative Leading Term)

**Expression:**
$$
\mathbf{-28x^4y^4 + 24xy^3 + 32xy^2}
$$

---

#### **Step 1: Determine the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**

Find the GCF of the coefficients and the variables. Since the leading term ($-28x^4y^4$) is negative, we factor out a **negative** GCF.

1.  **GCF of Coefficients (28, 24, 32):** The greatest common factor for the numbers is **4**. Since we factor out the negative sign, the coefficient GCF is **-4**.
    * $28 = 4 \cdot 7$
    * $24 = 4 \cdot 6$
    * $32 = 4 \cdot 8$

2.  **GCF of Variables ($x$):** The lowest power of $x$ present in all three terms is $x^1$ (from $24xy^3$ and $32xy^2$). The first term has $x^4$.
    * $\text{GCF}(x) = \mathbf{x}$

3.  **GCF of Variables ($y$):** The lowest power of $y$ present in all three terms is $y^2$ (from $32xy^2$).
    * $\text{GCF}(y) = \mathbf{y^2}$

**Overall GCF:** $\mathbf{-4xy^2}$

---

#### **Step 2: Divide Each Term by the GCF**

Divide each term of the original polynomial by the GCF ($\mathbf{-4xy^2}$).

1.  $\frac{-28x^4y^4}{-4xy^2} = \mathbf{7x^3y^2}$ (The negative signs cancel.)
2.  $\frac{+24xy^3}{-4xy^2} = \mathbf{-6y}$ (The signs are different, resulting in a negative.)
3.  $\frac{+32xy^2}{-4xy^2} = \mathbf{-8}$ (The signs are different, resulting in a negative.)

---

#### **Step 3: Write the Factored Form**

Write the GCF outside the parentheses, followed by the resulting expression from Step 2.

$$
\mathbf{-4xy^2(7x^3y^2 - 6y - 8)}
$$

- **Factoring by Grouping** steps : 
  1) Look for the GCF of all terms, when this is not 1, factor this term out to begin
  2) Arrange the terms in two groups of two terms each, such that each group has a common factor
  3) Factor the GCF out of each group, we should be left with a common binomial factor
  4) In some cases, we must try a different grouping
- **GCF = Greatest Common Factor** = The greatest common factor is the largest term that each term of the polynomial is divisible by
- **Common Binomial Factor** = is a two-term polynomial expression (a binomial) that is shared between two or more terms in a larger expression, allowing it to be factored out using the distributive property, most often seen after factoring by grouping.
- When factoring while grouping, in alot of cases there is more than one way to group the terms and it will still work, and give the same answer

## Algebra II - Lesson 42 - Factoring Trinomials with a Leading Coefficient of 1 - 09November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=18h50m45s
- **Trinomial** : $ax^2 + bx +c$ : a polynomial with three terms
- **Leading Coefficent of 1** : means that the first term '$ax^2$' the 'a' is '1'
- $(x+3)(x+9) = x^2 + 12x + 27$ : using FOIL and the distributive property we can get the answer, but to factor it back we can find 2 numbers that can 'sum'(add) up to '12' and 'product'(multiply) up to '27'
- if you want a 'positive product' and a 'negative sum' you need $(x - c)(x -k)$ 
### Factoring a Trinomial: $x^2 + 2x - 35$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$x^2 + 2x - 35$$

#### Goal
Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$) such that:
* $p \cdot q = -35$ (The constant term, $c$)
* $p + q = 2$ (The coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$)

#### Step 1: Find the factors of -35
List the pairs of integers that multiply to -35:
* -1 and 35
* 1 and -35
* -5 and 7
* 5 and -7

#### Step 2: Check the sums
Check which pair adds up to 2:
* $-1 + 35 = 34$
* $1 + (-35) = -34$
* **$-5 + 7 = 2$** (This is the correct pair!)
* $5 + (-7) = -2$

The two numbers are **7** and **-5**.

#### Step 3: Write the Factored Form
Use the two numbers found to write the binomial factors:
$$(x + 7)(x - 5)$$

#### Step 4: Verification (Optional)
Expand the factored form to check:
$$(x + 7)(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x + 7x - 35$$
$$= x^2 + 2x - 35$$ (Matches the original trinomial)

---

#### Final Factored Form

### Factoring a Trinomial with GCF: $4r^2 + 20r + 16$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$4r^2 + 20r + 16$$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of $4, 20,$ and $16$ is **4**.
$$4(r^2 + 5r + 4)$$

#### Step 2: Factor the Simplified Trinomial
Now, factor the trinomial inside the parentheses: $r^2 + 5r + 4$.
Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$) such that:
* $p \cdot q = 4$ (The constant term)
* $p + q = 5$ (The coefficient of the $r$ term)

The two numbers are **4** and **1** (since $4 \cdot 1 = 4$ and $4 + 1 = 5$).

#### Step 3: Write the Factored Form
Replace the trinomial with its binomial factors, keeping the GCF (4) outside:
$$4(r + 4)(r + 1)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$4(r + 4)(r + 1)$$
### Factoring a Trinomial with GCF: $6p^4 - 84p^3 + 240p^2$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$6p^4 - 84p^3 + 240p^2$$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of the coefficients ($6, 84, 240$) is **6**.
The GCF of the variables ($p^4, p^3, p^2$) is **$p^2$**.
The overall GCF is **$6p^2$**.

Factor out $6p^2$:
$$6p^2(p^2 - 14p + 40)$$

#### Step 2: Factor the Remaining Trinomial
Now, factor the trinomial inside the parentheses: $p^2 - 14p + 40$.
Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$) such that:
* $p \cdot q = 40$ (The constant term, $c$)
* $p + q = -14$ (The coefficient of the $p$ term, $b$)

Since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative. The two numbers are **-4** and **-10** (since $(-4) \cdot (-10) = 40$ and $(-4) + (-10) = -14$).

#### Step 3: Write the Fully Factored Form
Replace the trinomial with its binomial factors, keeping the GCF ($6p^2$) outside:
$$6p^2(p - 4)(p - 10)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$6p^2(p - 4)(p - 10)$$
### Factoring a Two-Variable Trinomial: $x^2 + 8xy + 7y^2$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$x^2 + 8xy + 7y^2$$

#### Goal
Find two coefficients ($p$ and $q$) such that:
* $p \cdot q = 7$ (The constant term coefficient, $c$)
* $p + q = 8$ (The coefficient of the $xy$ term, $b$)

#### Step 1: Find the factors
List the pairs of integers that multiply to 7:
* 1 and 7
* -1 and -7

#### Step 2: Check the sums
Check which pair adds up to 8:
* **$1 + 7 = 8$** (This is the correct pair!)
* $-1 + (-7) = -8$

The two coefficients are **1** and **7**.

#### Step 3: Write the Factored Form
The factors must include the variable $y$ in the second term to correctly produce the $xy$ and $y^2$ terms upon expansion:
$$(x + 1y)(x + 7y)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$(x + y)(x + 7y)$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 43 - Factoring Trinomials with a Leading Coefficient that is not 1 (Factoring by Grouping) - AC Method - 09November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=19h6m
- When factoring, just go down the list (1, 2, 3, 4) etc, and see what times what equals the number of the product, then you look at the list you have and see what sums you can get for the correct factoring
- There's 2 ways to find the Factor when the leading coefficient isn't a 1 :
	1) Reversing the FOIL process
	2) Factoring by group 
- **Factoring by grouping (with leading coefficient of non 1)** = **AC Method** : $ax^2 + bx + c$ :  'a' = the coefficient for the squared variable, 'b' = the coefficient for the variable raised to the first power, 'c' is the constant : You need to find a product(multiply) of 'ac' (so you will need to multiply 'a' * 'c' and then factor it for 2 numbers that can sum to 'b', but wait, theres more, after finding your 2 numbers, plug them in to a new polynomial in the format of $ax^2 + px + qx +c$ where 'p' and 'q' are the 2 numbers that can sum to 'b', but seperated, now, factoring by grouping and pull out the common factors again from the grouped numbers, and then find a *common binomial factor* and then take the terms outside of the CBF and create a second '()' parenthesis term) and a sum(add) of 'b' 
### Factoring Trinomials with a Non-1 Leading Coefficient (The AC Method)

The **AC Method** is a technique used to factor a trinomial in the standard form $\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c}$ when the leading coefficient, **$a$**, is not equal to 1. It is essentially an application of **factoring by grouping**.

**Key Terms:**
* **$a$**: The coefficient of the squared term ($x^2$).
* **$b$**: The coefficient of the linear term ($x$).
* **$c$**: The constant term.

---

#### The AC Method Steps

The goal is to split the middle term, **$bx$**, into two new terms, **$px$** and **$qx$**, so that the trinomial can be factored by grouping.

1.  **Find the Product $a \cdot c$**: Calculate the product of the leading coefficient ($a$) and the constant term ($c$).
2.  **Find the Numbers ($p$ and $q$)**: Find two numbers, $p$ and $q$, that satisfy two conditions:
    * **Multiply** to the product $a \cdot c$.
    * **Add up** to the middle coefficient $b$.
3.  **Rewrite the Trinomial**: Substitute the middle term $bx$ with the two new terms, $px$ and $qx$:
    $$ax^2 + px + qx + c$$
4.  **Factor by Grouping**: Group the first two terms and the last two terms, then factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) from each group.
5.  **Identify and Factor out the Common Binomial Factor (CBF)**: The two resulting terms should share a common binomial factor. Factor out this CBF to get the final factored form.

---

#### Example: Factoring $2x^2 + 5x - 12$

**Problem:** $2x^2 + 5x - 12$
($a=2$, $b=5$, $c=-12$)

1.  **Find $a \cdot c$**:
    $$2 \cdot (-12) = -24$$

2.  **Find two numbers ($p, q$)** that multiply to **-24** and add up to **5**:
    * The numbers are **8** and **-3** ($8 \cdot -3 = -24$ and $8 + (-3) = 5$).

3.  **Rewrite the trinomial** using $8x$ and $-3x$:
    $$2x^2 + 8x - 3x - 12$$

4.  **Factor by Grouping**:
    $$(2x^2 + 8x) + (-3x - 12)$$
    * Factor GCF from the first group: $$2x(x + 4)$$
    * Factor GCF from the second group (must factor out **$-3$** to get the matching binomial): $$-3(x + 4)$$

5.  **Factor out the Common Binomial Factor**:
    $$2x\underbrace{(x + 4)}_{\text{CBF}} - 3\underbrace{(x + 4)}_{\text{CBF}}$$
    $$(x + 4)(2x - 3)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form

### Factoring a Trinomial ($ax^2 + bx + c$) by Grouping: $8x^2 + 51x + 18$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$8x^2 + 51x + 18$$

#### Step 1: Find the Product $a \cdot c$
Multiply the coefficient of the $x^2$ term ($a=8$) by the constant term ($c=18$).
$$a \cdot c = 8 \cdot 18 = 144$$

#### Step 2: Find two numbers
Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$) that:
* **Multiply** to $144$
* **Add up** to $51$ (The coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$)

The two numbers are **3** and **48** (since $3 \cdot 48 = 144$ and $3 + 48 = 51$).

#### Step 3: Rewrite the middle term
Rewrite the middle term, $51x$, using the two numbers found (3 and 48).
$$8x^2 + 3x + 48x + 18$$

#### Step 4: Factor by Grouping
Group the first two terms and the last two terms:
$$(8x^2 + 3x) + (48x + 18)$$

1.  **First Group** $(8x^2 + 3x)$:
    * The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is **$x$**.
    * $$x(8x + 3)$$
2.  **Second Group** $(48x + 18)$:
    * The GCF is **$6$**.
    * $$6(8x + 3)$$

#### Step 5: Factor out the Common Binomial
The expression is now:
$$x(8x + 3) + 6(8x + 3)$$

$$(8x + 3)(x + 6)$$

#### Step 1: Find the Product $a \cdot c$
Calculate the product of the leading coefficient ($a=10$) and the constant term ($c=-9$).
$$a \cdot c = 10 \cdot (-9) = -90$$

#### Step 2: Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$)
Find two numbers that:
* **Multiply** to $-90$
* **Add up** to $43$ (The coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$)

Since the product is negative, one number must be positive and one must be negative. Since the sum is a large positive number, the positive factor must be much larger than the negative factor.
The two numbers are **45** and **-2** (since $45 \cdot (-2) = -90$ and $45 + (-2) = 43$).

#### Step 3: Rewrite the middle term
Rewrite the middle term, $43x$, using the two numbers found ($45x$ and $-2x$).

    * The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is **$5x$**.
    * $$5x(2x + 9)$$
2.  **Second Group** $(-2x - 9)$:
    * The GCF is **$-1$** (factoring out $-1$ is crucial to make the binomial match).
    * $$-1(2x + 9)$$

#### Step 5: Factor out the Common Binomial
The expression is now:
$$5x(2x + 9) - 1(2x + 9)$$
Factor out the common binomial factor, **$(2x + 9)$**:
$$(2x + 9)(5x - 1)$$

Since the product is negative, one number must be positive and one must be negative. Since the sum is negative, the larger factor (in absolute value) must be negative.
The two numbers are **10** and **-15** (since $10 \cdot (-15) = -150$ and $10 + (-15) = -5$).

#### Step 3: Rewrite the middle term
Rewrite the middle term, $-5x$, using the two numbers found ($10x$ and $-15x$).
$$6x^2 + 10x - 15x - 25$$

#### Step 4: Factor by Grouping
Group the first two terms and the last two terms:
$$(6x^2 + 10x) + (-15x - 25)$$

1.  **First Group** $(6x^2 + 10x)$:
    * The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is **$2x$**.
    * $$2x(3x + 5)$$
2.  **Second Group** $(-15x - 25)$:
    * The GCF is **$-5$** (factoring out $-5$ is crucial to make the binomial match).
    * $$-5(3x + 5)$$

#### Step 5: Factor out the Common Binomial
The expression is now:
$$2x(3x + 5) - 5(3x + 5)$$
Factor out the common binomial factor, **$(3x + 5)$**:
$$(3x + 5)(2x - 5)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$(3x + 5)(2x - 5)$$
### Factoring a Two-Variable Trinomial by Grouping: $8x^2 - 26xy + 20y^2$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$8x^2 - 26xy + 20y^2$$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of the coefficients ($8, 26,$ and $20$) is **2**.
$$2(4x^2 - 13xy + 10y^2)$$

#### Step 2: Apply the AC Method (on the inner trinomial)
We need to factor $4x^2 - 13xy + 10y^2$.
($a=4$, $b=-13$, $c=10$).

Find the product $a \cdot c$:
$$4 \cdot 10 = 40$$

#### Step 3: Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$)
Find two numbers that:
* **Multiply** to $40$
* **Add up** to $-13$ (The coefficient of the $xy$ term)

Since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative.
The two numbers are **-8** and **-5** (since $(-8) \cdot (-5) = 40$ and $(-8) + (-5) = -13$).

#### Step 4: Rewrite the middle term
Rewrite the middle term, $-13xy$, using the two numbers found ($-8xy$ and $-5xy$).
Remember to keep the initial GCF (2) outside:
$$2[4x^2 - 8xy - 5xy + 10y^2]$$

#### Step 5: Factor by Grouping (Inside the brackets)
Group the terms inside the brackets:
$$2[(4x^2 - 8xy) + (-5xy + 10y^2)]$$

1.  **First Group** $(4x^2 - 8xy)$:
    * The GCF is **$4x$**.
    * $$4x(x - 2y)$$
2.  **Second Group** $(-5xy + 10y^2)$:
    * The GCF is **$-5y$** (factoring out $-5y$ is crucial to make the binomial match).
    * $$-5y(x - 2y)$$

#### Step 6: Factor out the Common Binomial
The expression is now:
$$2[4x(x - 2y) - 5y(x - 2y)]$$
Factor out the common binomial factor, **$(x - 2y)$**:
$$2(x - 2y)(4x - 5y)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$2(x - 2y)(4x - 5y)$$
### Factoring a Two-Variable Trinomial by Grouping: $12x^2 + 33xy - 9y^2$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$12x^2 + 33xy - 9y^2$$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of the coefficients ($12, 33,$ and $9$) is **3**.
$$3(4x^2 + 11xy - 3y^2)$$

#### Step 2: Apply the AC Method (on the inner trinomial)
We need to factor $4x^2 + 11xy - 3y^2$.
($a=4$, $b=11$, $c=-3$).

Find the product $a \cdot c$:
$$4 \cdot (-3) = -12$$

#### Step 3: Find two numbers ($p$ and $q$)
Find two numbers that:
* **Multiply** to $-12$
* **Add up** to $11$ (The coefficient of the $xy$ term)

The two numbers are **12** and **-1** (since $12 \cdot (-1) = -12$ and $12 + (-1) = 11$).

#### Step 4: Rewrite the middle term
Rewrite the middle term, $11xy$, using the two numbers found ($12xy$ and $-1xy$).
Remember to keep the initial GCF (3) outside:
$$3[4x^2 + 12xy - 1xy - 3y^2]$$

#### Step 5: Factor by Grouping (Inside the brackets)
Group the terms inside the brackets:
$$3[(4x^2 + 12xy) + (-1xy - 3y^2)]$$

1.  **First Group** $(4x^2 + 12xy)$:
    * The GCF is **$4x$**.
    * $$4x(x + 3y)$$
2.  **Second Group** $(-1xy - 3y^2)$:
    * The GCF is **$-y$** (factoring out $-y$ is crucial to make the binomial match).
    * $$-y(x + 3y)$$

#### Step 6: Factor out the Common Binomial
The expression is now:
$$3[4x(x + 3y) - y(x + 3y)]$$
Factor out the common binomial factor, **$(x + 3y)$**:
$$3(x + 3y)(4x - y)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$3(x + 3y)(4x - y)$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 44 - Factoring Trinomials with a Leading Coefficient that is not 1 (Reverse FOIL - Trial and Error) - 10November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=19h28m20s
- **FOIL** = First Terms, Outer Terms, Inner Terms, Last Terms - used for 2 pairs of binomials
- **Reverse Foil Process** : First Solve for the first term generally the leading term and coefficient multiplied by 'x' or whatever, next solve for the 'c' (what times what would multiply to 'c') but the outer and inner can combine to give you the correct outer and inner 
- **Leading Coefficient that isn't prime** = If you have a leading coefficient that isn't prime, you need to also go through all the factors of that as well, 
- You should also pull out any common factors before beginning (like, if everything is divisible by 2, pull out the 2)
- when you plug in numbers to test them in trial and error, if you have common factors on both binomials, you can remove them, because it won't work, it should already be reduced
- if the trinomial has a constant with the final term as a '+' and a middle term as a '-' negative, then you know it's multiply a negative by a negative

### Factoring Trinomials with $a \neq 1$: Reverse FOIL (Trial and Error)

The **Reverse FOIL** method is a trial-and-error strategy used to factor a trinomial in the form $\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c}$ when the leading coefficient, **$a$**, is not equal to 1. This method requires systematically checking factor combinations until the correct middle term, $bx$, is achieved.

**Contrast with AC Method:**
* **AC Method (Grouping):** Guaranteed to work if the trinomial is factorable; involves more writing.
* **Reverse FOIL (Trial & Error):** Faster if the correct combination is found quickly; involves more mental calculation.

---

#### Reverse FOIL Steps

The factored form will be a product of two binomials:
$$(\square x + \square)(\square x + \square)$$

1.  **Factor the $a$ Term**: Find all pairs of factors for the leading coefficient, **$a$**. These factors will go into the first position of each parenthesis.
    * *Example: If $a=6$, try factors (1, 6) and (2, 3).*
2.  **Factor the $c$ Term**: Find all pairs of factors for the constant term, **$c$**. These factors will go into the second position of each parenthesis.
    * *Example: If $c=8$, try factors (1, 8), (2, 4), (-1, -8), (-2, -4).*
3.  **Test Combinations (The FOIL Check)**: Systematically test combinations of the $a$ factors and $c$ factors. Use the **O**uter and **I**nner products from the FOIL method to see if their sum equals the middle term, **$b$**.
    * $(\mathbf{F} + \mathbf{O} + \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{L})$ must equal $ax^2 + bx + c$.
    * Only the sum of $\mathbf{O}$uter and $\mathbf{I}$nner terms must equal $bx$.

---

#### Example: Factoring $3x^2 + 10x + 8$

**Problem:** $3x^2 + 10x + 8$
($a=3$, $b=10$, $c=8$)

1.  **Factor $a$ (3)**: The only factors for $a=3$ are (1, 3).
    * Starting form: $$(1x \quad \square)(3x \quad \square)$$
2.  **Factor $c$ (8)**: Possible factors for $c=8$ are (1, 8), (8, 1), (2, 4), and (4, 2). Since $b$ is positive, we only test positive factors.
3.  **Test Combinations** (Find $b=10$): We only need to check the sum of the **Outer** and **Inner** products.

| $a$ Factors | $c$ Factors | Test Combination | Outer + Inner Product (Should equal 10x) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| (1, 3) | (1, 8) | $(x+1)(3x+8)$ | $(8x) + (3x) = 11x$ (**NO**) |
| (1, 3) | (8, 1) | $(x+8)(3x+1)$ | $(x) + (24x) = 25x$ (**NO**) |
| (1, 3) | (2, 4) | $(x+2)(3x+4)$ | $(4x) + (6x) = \mathbf{10x}$ (**YES**) |
| (1, 3) | (4, 2) | $(x+4)(3x+2)$ | $(2x) + (12x) = 14x$ (**NO**) |

#### Final Factored Form
The correct combination is $(x+2)(3x+4)$.
$$(x + 2)(3x + 4)$$
### Factoring Trinomials with Reverse Foil ( $2x^2 + 23x + 63$)

**Problem:** $2x^2 + 23x + 63$
($a=2$, $b=23$, $c=63$)

#### Step 1: Factor the $a$ Term (2)
The only factors for the leading coefficient $a=2$ are (1, 2).
* Starting form: $$(1x \quad \square)(2x \quad \square)$$

#### Step 2: Factor the $c$ Term (63)
Possible factors for the constant term $c=63$ are:
* (1, 63), (63, 1)
* (3, 21), (21, 3)
* (7, 9), (9, 7)
*(Since $b=23$ is positive, we only test positive factor pairs.)*

#### Step 3: Test Combinations (Find $b=23$)
We systematically check the sum of the **Outer** and **Inner** products until it equals the middle term, **$23x$**.

| $a$ Factors | $c$ Factors | Test Combination | Outer Product + Inner Product (Target: 23x) | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| (1, 2) | (1, 63) | $(x+1)(2x+63)$ | $(63x) + (2x) = 65x$ | NO |
| (1, 2) | (63, 1) | $(x+63)(2x+1)$ | $(x) + (126x) = 127x$ | NO |
| (1, 2) | (3, 21) | $(x+3)(2x+21)$ | $(21x) + (6x) = 27x$ | NO |
| (1, 2) | (21, 3) | $(x+21)(2x+3)$ | $(3x) + (42x) = 45x$ | NO |
| (1, 2) | (7, 9) | $(x+7)(2x+9)$ | $(9x) + (14x) = \mathbf{23x}$ | **YES** |

#### Final Factored Form
The correct combination is $(x+7)(2x+9)$.
$$(x + 7)(2x + 9)$$
### Factoring Trinomials with a $\neq 1$: Reverse FOIL ($40x^2 - 172x + 112$)

**Problem:** $40x^2 - 172x + 112$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF is 4.
$$4(10x^2 - 43x + 28)$$

#### Step 2: Apply Reverse FOIL to $10x^2 - 43x + 28$
Find factors for $a=10$ (e.g., (2, 5)) and $c=28$ (e.g., (-7, -4)).

Test Combination (Outer + Inner products must equal -43x):
$$(2x - 7)(5x - 4)$$
* Outer: $2x \cdot (-4) = -8x$
* Inner: $-7 \cdot 5x = -35x$
* Sum: $-8x - 35x = -43x$ (Match!)

#### Step 3: Final Factored Form
Combine the GCF with the binomial factors.
$$4(2x - 7)(5x - 4)$$
### Factoring a Trinomial with GCF & Reverse FOIL: $8x^2 + 34xy + 36y^2$

The trinomial to factor is:
$$8x^2 + 34xy + 36y^2$$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of the coefficients (8, 34, and 36) is **2**.
$$2(4x^2 + 17xy + 18y^2)$$

#### Step 2: Apply Reverse FOIL to the Inner Trinomial
We must factor the simplified trinomial: $4x^2 + 17xy + 18y^2$.
($a=4$, $b=17$, $c=18$).

* **Factor $a$ (4)**: Possible factors are (1, 4) and (2, 2).
* **Factor $c$ (18)**: Since $b$ is positive, we only test positive factors: (1, 18), (2, 9), (3, 6). The factors of $c$ will be multiplied by $y$.

#### Step 3: Test ALL Combinations (Find $b=17$)
We look for a combination where the sum of the **Outer** and **Inner** products is $17xy$.

| $a$ Factors | $c$ Factors | Test Combination | Outer + Inner Product (Target: 17xy) | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| (1, 4) | (1, 18) | $(x+y)(4x+18y)$ | $18xy + 4xy = 22xy$ | NO |
| (1, 4) | (18, 1) | $(x+18y)(4x+y)$ | $xy + 72xy = 73xy$ | NO |
| (1, 4) | (2, 9) | $(x+2y)(4x+9y)$ | $9xy + 8xy = \mathbf{17xy}$ | **YES** |
| (1, 4) | (9, 2) | $(x+9y)(4x+2y)$ | $2xy + 36xy = 38xy$ | NO |
| (1, 4) | (3, 6) | $(x+3y)(4x+6y)$ | $6xy + 12xy = 18xy$ | NO |
| (1, 4) | (6, 3) | $(x+6y)(4x+3y)$ | $3xy + 24xy = 27xy$ | NO |
| (2, 2) | (1, 18) | $(2x+y)(2x+18y)$ | $36xy + 2xy = 38xy$ | NO |
| (2, 2) | (2, 9) | $(2x+2y)(2x+9y)$ | $18xy + 4xy = 22xy$ | NO |
| (2, 2) | (3, 6) | $(2x+3y)(2x+6y)$ | $12xy + 6xy = 18xy$ | NO |

#### Step 4: Write the Final Factored Form
Combine the initial GCF (2) with the two binomial factors:
$$2(x + 2y)(4x + 9y)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$2(x + 2y)(4x + 9y)$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 45 - Factoring Polynomials using Substitution - 10November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=19h50m
- You can replace any 'x' to the power value with a new variable to make it easier to read
- When you make a substitution, you must replace it at the end with the original values
- $ax^2 + bx^1 + c$ : as long as the value you are substituting is in a '2' to '1' variable exponent power for 'a' to 'b' ratio, you can use this method
### Factoring a Quadratic-like Trinomial (Substitution Method) ($7x^4 + 20x^2 + 12$)

**Problem:** $7x^4 + 20x^2 + 12$

This polynomial is "quadratic-like" because the highest exponent ($x^4$) is double the middle exponent ($x^2$).

#### Step 1: Substitution
Let **$u$** be the substitute for the middle term's variable part:
$$u = x^2$$
Rewrite the original polynomial in terms of $u$:
$$7u^2 + 20u + 12$$

#### Step 2: Factor the Simplified Trinomial (Reverse FOIL)
We factor $7u^2 + 20u + 12$ using trial and error.
* **$a=7$** factors: (1, 7).
* **$c=12$** factors: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4).
* **Target sum for O + I:** $20u$.

**Test Combination:** $(u + 2)(7u + 6)$
* Outer Product: $u \cdot 6 = 6u$
* Inner Product: $2 \cdot 7u = 14u$
* Sum of O + I: $6u + 14u = 20u$ (**Match**)

The factored form in $u$ is:
$$(u + 2)(7u + 6)$$

#### Step 3: Substitute Back
Substitute $x^2$ back in for $u$.
$$(x^2 + 2)(7x^2 + 6)$$

#### Step 4: Check for Further Factoring
Neither binomial is a difference of squares, and they cannot be factored further.

### Factoring a Quadratic-like Trinomial (Substitution Method)( $27x^6 - 54x^3 + 15$)

**Problem:** $27x^6 - 54x^3 + 15$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of 27, 54, and 15 is **3**.
$$3(9x^6 - 18x^3 + 5)$$

#### Step 2: Substitution
Let **$z$** represent the variable part of the middle term:
$$z = x^3$$
Rewrite the expression in terms of $z$:
$$3(9z^2 - 18z + 5)$$

#### Step 3: Factor the Inner Trinomial ($9z^2 - 18z + 5$)
We use the AC Method (Grouping) on the trinomial $9z^2 - 18z + 5$.
* $a \cdot c = 9 \cdot 5 = 45$.
* Two numbers that multiply to 45 and add to $-18$ are **$-3$** and **$-15$**.

Rewrite the middle term:
$$3[9z^2 - 3z - 15z + 5]$$

Factor by Grouping:
$$3[(9z^2 - 3z) + (-15z + 5)]$$
$$3[3z(3z - 1) - 5(3z - 1)]$$

Factor out the Common Binomial Factor:
$$3(3z - 1)(3z - 5)$$

#### Step 4: Substitute Back
Substitute $x^3$ back in for $z$:
$$3(3x^3 - 1)(3x^3 - 5)$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$3(3x^3 - 1)(3x^3 - 5)$$
### Factoring a Complex Quadratic Form (Substitution Method)($4(x - 5)^2 - 4(x - 5) - 15$)

**Problem:** $4(x - 5)^2 - 4(x - 5) - 15$

#### Step 1: Substitution
Let **$q$** be the substitute for the repeated binomial:
$$q = (x - 5)$$
Rewrite the original expression in terms of $q$:
$$4q^2 - 4q - 15$$

#### Step 2: Factor the Simplified Trinomial ($4q^2 - 4q - 15$)
We use the **AC Method** (Factoring by Grouping) or **Reverse FOIL** on the trinomial $4q^2 - 4q - 15$. We'll use the AC Method here for clarity.

* $a \cdot c = 4 \cdot (-15) = -60$.
* Two numbers that multiply to $-60$ and add to $-4$ are **$6$** and **$-10$**.

Rewrite the middle term:
$$4q^2 + 6q - 10q - 15$$

Factor by Grouping:
$$(4q^2 + 6q) + (-10q - 15)$$
$$2q(2q + 3) - 5(2q + 3)$$

Factor out the Common Binomial Factor:
$$(2q + 3)(2q - 5)$$

#### Step 3: Substitute Back
Substitute the original term $(x - 5)$ back in for $q$:
$$[2(x - 5) + 3] [2(x - 5) - 5]$$

#### Step 4: Simplify the Factors
Distribute the 2 in each bracket and combine constants:

* **First Factor:**
  $$2x - 10 + 3 = 2x - 7$$
* **Second Factor:**
  $$2x - 10 - 5 = 2x - 15$$

### Factoring Binomials: Difference of Squares ($4x^2 - 1$)

The **Difference of Squares** formula is used to factor binomials in the form $\mathbf{a^2 - b^2}$.

**Formula:**
$$a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$$

#### Problem: Factor $4x^2 - 1$

1.  **Identify $a^2$ and $b^2$**:
    * The first term, $4x^2$, is $a^2$.
    * The second term, $1$, is $b^2$.

2.  **Find $a$ and $b$ (The Square Roots)**:
    * Find the square root of $a^2$: $\sqrt{4x^2} = \mathbf{2x}$ (This is $a$)
    * Find the square root of $b^2$: $\sqrt{1} = \mathbf{1}$ (This is $b$)

### Factoring a Perfect Square Trinomial (PST) ($50x^2 + 60x + 18$)

**Problem:** $50x^2 + 60x + 18$

#### Step 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The GCF of 50, 60, and 18 is **2**.
$$2(25x^2 + 30x + 9)$$

#### Step 2: Identify PST Components
We focus on the trinomial inside the parentheses: $25x^2 + 30x + 9$. We check if it fits the PST formula: $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2$.

1.  **Find the square root of the first term ($x$):**
    $$\sqrt{25x^2} = \mathbf{5x}$$
2.  **Find the square root of the last term ($y$):**
    $$\sqrt{9} = \mathbf{3}$$
3.  **Check the middle term ($2xy$):**
    $$2 \cdot (5x) \cdot (3) = 30x$$
    Since the middle term **is** $30x$, this is a Perfect Square Trinomial!

#### Step 3: Write the Factored Form
The factored form of the trinomial is the square of the binomial: $(5x + 3)^2$.

Combine this with the initial GCF:
$$2(5x + 3)^2$$

---

#### Final Factored Form
$$2(5x + 3)^2$$
### Factoring a Perfect Square Trinomial (PST) ($49n^4 - 42n^2 + 9$)

**Problem:** $49n^4 - 42n^2 + 9$

#### Step 1: Check for PST Structure
We check if the first and last terms are perfect squares and if the middle term fits the $2xy$ rule.

1.  **Find the square root of the first term ($x$):**
    $$\sqrt{49n^4} = \mathbf{7n^2}$$
    (This is the first term, $x$, of the binomial)
2.  **Find the square root of the last term ($y$):**
    $$\sqrt{9} = \mathbf{3}$$
    (This is the second term, $y$, of the binomial)
3.  **Check the middle term (Should be $-2xy$):**
    $$-2 \cdot (7n^2) \cdot (3) = -42n^2$$
    Since the middle term **is** $-42n^2$, this is a Perfect Square Trinomial.

#### Step 2: Write the Factored Form
Use the PST formula $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x - y)^2$ with $x=7n^2$ and $y=3$.

$$(7n^2 - 3)^2$$

- A **rational number** is the quotient of 2 integers : like 2/3 or 5/7
- **Rational Expression** = is the quotient of 2 polynomials
- $\frac{p}{q}$ where $q$ can not be zero, because it is undefined - non-zero denominator
- The **Domain** of a rational function includes all values that result in a non-zero denominator
- Domain : {$x|x\ne0$} : the set of all values for x such that 'x' does not equal '0'
- When you cancel terms out from rational expressions, information is lost, so make sure you get your restricted values (which cause the denominator to be 0) using the zero product rule BEFORE you cancel values in the numerator and denominator

#### Step 1: Factor Each Polynomial

The key to multiplying rational expressions is to **factor every component** completely.

#### **Numerator 1: $7x^2 + 73x + 90$**

    $7x^2 + 73x + 90 = 7x^2 + 63x + 10x + 90$
    $= 7x(x + 9) + 10(x + 9)$

#### **Denominator 1: $14x^2 - 22x - 60$**
* Factor out the **GCF (2)** first:
    $2(7x^2 - 11x - 30)$
* Factor the trinomial ($ac=-210$, sums to -11):
    $2(7x^2 - 21x + 10x - 30)$
    $= 2[7x(x - 3) + 10(x - 3)]$
    **Result: $2(7x + 10)(x - 3)$**

#### **Numerator 2: $2x - 6$**

$$\frac{(7x + 10)(x + 9)}{2(7x + 10)(x - 3)} \cdot \frac{2(x - 3)}{10x(x - 4)}$$

We can **cancel** factors that appear in both a numerator and a denominator:

* $\cancel{(7x + 10)}$
* $\cancel{2}$
* $\cancel{(x - 3)}$

$$\frac{\cancel{(7x + 10)}(x + 9)}{\cancel{2}\cancel{(7x + 10)}\cancel{(x - 3)}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{2}\cancel{(x - 3)}}{10x(x - 4)}$$

**Problem:**
$$\frac{-2a + 2}{a - 1} \div \frac{40 - 5a}{5a - 40}$$

---

#### 1. Convert Division to Multiplication

The first step in dividing rational expressions is to **Keep-Change-Flip** (multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second):

$$\frac{-2a + 2}{a - 1} \cdot \frac{5a - 40}{40 - 5a}$$

---

#### 2. Factor All Polynomials

We **factor** each polynomial completely to identify common terms for cancellation.

* **Numerator 1:** $-2a + 2$
    * Factor out **$-2$**: $\mathbf{-2(a - 1)}$

* **Denominator 1:** $a - 1$
    * **Result:** $\mathbf{(a - 1)}$

* **Numerator 2:** $5a - 40$
    * Factor out **$5$**: $\mathbf{5(a - 8)}$

* **Denominator 2:** $40 - 5a$
    * Factor out **$-5$** to match the term in the numerator: $\mathbf{-5(a - 8)}$

---

#### 3. Rewrite and Cancel Common Factors

Substitute the factored forms and **cancel** the identical factors across the numerator and denominator:

$$\frac{-2\cancel{(a - 1)}}{\cancel{(a - 1)}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{5}\cancel{(a - 8)}}{\cancel{-5}\cancel{(a - 8)}}$$

The cancelled terms are:
* $\mathbf{(a - 1)}$
* $\mathbf{(a - 8)}$
* The constants $\frac{5}{-5}$ simplifies to $\mathbf{-1}$.

---

#### 4. Final Answer

Multiply the remaining coefficients:

$$\frac{-2}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{-1} = \frac{-2}{-1}$$

**Final Simplified Expression:**
$$\mathbf{2}$$

Substitute the factored forms and **cancel** the identical factors across the numerator and denominator:

$$\frac{7(7n - 4)}{4n} \cdot \frac{5n}{5n(7n - 4)}$$

We can cancel the following:
* $\mathbf{(7n - 4)}$
* $\mathbf{5n}$

$$\frac{7\cancel{(7n - 4)}}{4\cancel{n}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{5n}}{\cancel{5n}\cancel{(7n - 4)}}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

Multiply the remaining terms:

$$\frac{6x^2 + 10x}{15x^2 + 13x - 20} \cdot \frac{5x - 4}{45x^4}$$

---

#### 2. Factor All Polynomials

We **factor** each polynomial completely to prepare for cancellation.

* **Numerator 1:** $6x^2 + 10x$
    * Factor out the **GCF ($2x$)**: $\mathbf{2x(3x + 5)}$

* **Denominator 1:** $15x^2 + 13x - 20$
    * Factor the trinomial ($ac = 15 \cdot (-20) = -300$, factors sum to 13: 25 and -12):
        $15x^2 + 25x - 12x - 20$
        $= 5x(3x + 5) - 4(3x + 5)$
    * **Result:** $\mathbf{(5x - 4)(3x + 5)}$

## Algebra II - Lesson 50 - Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions - 13November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=21h30m30s
- When we add or subtract *Rational Expressions*, we follow the same rules we learned with fractions : 
- When the **Denominators** are the *same* you just add(or subtract) the **numerators** over the common denominator (the bottom numbers need to be the same, anything you do to the bottom, you need to do to the top) - simplify/factor before getting LCD and simplify/factor after adding/subtracting - then attempt to cancel any shared terms from the numerator and denominator
- **LCD** = **Lowest Common Denominator** = The smallest number that is shared by both fractions/rational expressions
- When you are subtracting, don't just subtract the first term, wrap it in parenthesis so future Sean knows that you are subtracting BOTH (or more) terms in the polynomial - also add parenthesis when you are multiplying terms to get a LCD
### ➕ Adding Rational Expressions with Common Denominators ($\frac{x - 4y}{6xy} + \frac{x + 3y}{6xy}$)

**Problem:**
$$\frac{x - 4y}{6xy} + \frac{x + 3y}{6xy}$$

---

#### 1. Combine the Numerators

Since the denominators are already the same, we combine the numerators over the single common denominator. **Be careful to include the terms from the second numerator completely.**

$$\frac{(x - 4y) + (x + 3y)}{6xy}$$

---

#### 2. Simplify the Numerator

Combine the like terms in the numerator:

* Combine the **$x$** terms: $x + x = 2x$
* Combine the **$y$** terms: $-4y + 3y = -y$

$$\frac{2x - y}{6xy}$$

---

#### 3. Final Simplified Expression

Since there is no Greatest Common Factor (GCF) that can be factored from the entire numerator ($2x - y$) to cancel with the denominator ($6xy$), the expression is fully simplified.

**Final Answer:**
$$\mathbf{\frac{2x - y}{6xy}}$$
### ➕ Adding Rational Expressions with Unlike Denominators ($\frac{4}{p + 4} + \frac{3p}{p - 4}$)

**Problem:**
$$\frac{4}{p + 4} + \frac{3p}{p - 4}$$

---

#### 1. Determine the LCD (Least Common Denominator)

Since the two denominators, $(p + 4)$ and $(p - 4)$, are not factorable and do not share any common factors, the LCD is their product.

$$\mathbf{LCD = (p + 4)(p - 4)}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite Each Fraction with the LCD

We multiply each fraction by a form of 1 to get the common denominator:

* **First Fraction:** Multiply by $\frac{(p - 4)}{(p - 4)}$
    $$\frac{4}{p + 4} \cdot \frac{(p - 4)}{(p - 4)} = \frac{4(p - 4)}{(p + 4)(p - 4)}$$

* **Second Fraction:** Multiply by $\frac{(p + 4)}{(p + 4)}$
    $$\frac{3p}{p - 4} \cdot \frac{(p + 4)}{(p + 4)} = \frac{3p(p + 4)}{(p - 4)(p + 4)}$$

---

#### 3. Combine the Numerators

Now we combine the numerators over the common denominator:

$$\frac{4(p - 4) + 3p(p + 4)}{(p + 4)(p - 4)}$$

---

#### 4. Simplify the Numerator

**A. Distribute:**
$$4p - 16 + 3p^2 + 12p$$

**B. Combine Like Terms:**
* $p^2$ term: $3p^2$
* $p$ terms: $4p + 12p = 16p$
* Constant term: $-16$

$$\frac{3p^2 + 16p - 16}{(p + 4)(p - 4)}$$

---

#### 5. Final Check for Simplification

Check if the numerator $3p^2 + 16p - 16$ can be factored to cancel with the denominator $(p + 4)$ or $(p - 4)$. (Factors of $3 \cdot -16 = -48$ that sum to 16 are not integers, so the numerator is prime).

**Final Answer:**
$$\mathbf{\frac{3p^2 + 16p - 16}{(p + 4)(p - 4)}}$$
### ➕ Adding Rational Expressions: $\frac{4}{2n^2 - 12n} + \frac{7n}{2}$

---

#### 1. Factor Denominators and Find the LCD

* **Denominator 1:** Factor out the GCF:
    $$2n^2 - 12n = \mathbf{2n(n - 6)}$$
* **Denominator 2:** $\mathbf{2}$
* The **LCD** must contain $2n$ and $(n - 6)$:
    $$\mathbf{LCD = 2n(n - 6)}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite Each Fraction with the LCD

* **First Fraction:** Already has the LCD.
    $$\frac{4}{2n(n - 6)}$$

* **Second Fraction:** Needs $n(n - 6)$ in the denominator:
    $$\frac{7n}{2} \cdot \frac{n(n - 6)}{n(n - 6)} = \frac{7n^2(n - 6)}{2n(n - 6)} = \frac{7n^3 - 42n^2}{2n(n - 6)}$$

---

#### 3. Combine and Simplify the Numerators

We combine the numerators over the common denominator and arrange in standard order:

$$\frac{4 + (7n^3 - 42n^2)}{2n(n - 6)} = \frac{7n^3 - 42n^2 + 4}{2n(n - 6)}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

The numerator is not factorable, so the expression is simplified.

$$\mathbf{\frac{7n^3 - 42n^2 + 4}{2n(n - 6)}}$$
### ➖ Subtracting Rational Expressions: $\frac{7}{2n^3 - 6n^2} - \frac{8}{n - 3}$

---

#### 1. Factor Denominators to Find the LCD

* **Denominator 1:** Factor out the GCF, $2n^2$:
    $$2n^3 - 6n^2 = \mathbf{2n^2(n - 3)}$$
* **Denominator 2:** $\mathbf{(n - 3)}$
* **Determine the LCD:** The LCD must include all unique factors: $2n^2$ and $(n - 3)$.
    $$\mathbf{LCD = 2n^2(n - 3)}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite Each Fraction with the LCD

* **First Fraction:** $\frac{7}{2n^2(n - 3)}$
    * This fraction already has the LCD.

* **Second Fraction:** $\frac{8}{n - 3}$
    * This fraction needs $2n^2$ in the denominator:
        $$\frac{8}{n - 3} \cdot \frac{2n^2}{2n^2} = \frac{16n^2}{2n^2(n - 3)}$$

---

#### 3. Combine the Numerators (Subtract!)

We subtract the numerators over the common denominator. **Crucially, the entire second numerator ($16n^2$) must be subtracted.**

$$\frac{7 - 16n^2}{2n^2(n - 3)}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

Since the numerator ($7 - 16n^2$) is not factorable in a way that allows cancellation with any part of the denominator, the expression is fully simplified.

$$\mathbf{\frac{7 - 16n^2}{2n^2(n - 3)}}$$
### ➕ Adding Rational Expressions: $\frac{6p - 8}{3p^2 + 20p - 7} + \frac{13p - 11}{p^2 + 6p - 7}$

---

#### 1. Factor Denominators to Find the LCD

We must factor both denominators completely to find the Least Common Denominator (LCD).

* **Denominator 1:** $3p^2 + 20p - 7$ (Factors of $3 \cdot -7 = -21$ that sum to 20 are 21 and -1)
    $$3p^2 + 21p - 1p - 7 = 3p(p + 7) - 1(p + 7) = \mathbf{(3p - 1)(p + 7)}$$

* **Denominator 2:** $p^2 + 6p - 7$ (Factors of -7 that sum to 6 are 7 and -1)
    $$\mathbf{(p + 7)(p - 1)}$$

* **Determine the LCD:** The LCD includes all unique factors:
    $$\mathbf{LCD = (3p - 1)(p + 7)(p - 1)}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite Each Fraction with the LCD

* **First Fraction:** $\frac{6p - 8}{(3p - 1)(p + 7)}$
    * Needs the factor $(p - 1)$:
        $$\frac{(6p - 8)(p - 1)}{(3p - 1)(p + 7)(p - 1)}$$

* **Second Fraction:** $\frac{13p - 11}{(p + 7)(p - 1)}$
    * Needs the factor $(3p - 1)$:
        $$\frac{(13p - 11)(3p - 1)}{(p + 7)(p - 1)(3p - 1)}$$

---

#### 3. Expand and Combine the Numerators

We place the expanded numerators over the common denominator.

**A. Expand Numerator 1:** $(6p - 8)(p - 1)$
$$6p^2 - 6p - 8p + 8 = 6p^2 - 14p + 8$$

**B. Expand Numerator 2:** $(13p - 11)(3p - 1)$
$$39p^2 - 13p - 33p + 11 = 39p^2 - 46p + 11$$

**C. Combine the expanded numerators (Addition):**
$$(6p^2 - 14p + 8) + (39p^2 - 46p + 11)$$
$$=(6p^2 + 39p^2) + (-14p - 46p) + (8 + 11)$$
$$\mathbf{45p^2 - 60p + 19}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

$$\mathbf{\frac{45p^2 - 60p + 19}{(3p - 1)(p + 7)(p - 1)}}$$
### ➖ Subtracting Rational Expressions: $\frac{5x - 5}{x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3} - \frac{2x + 7}{x^2 + 4x + 3}$

---

#### 1. Factor All Denominators and Numerators

We factor all polynomials to identify the Least Common Denominator (LCD) and any initial cancellations.

* **Numerator 1:** Factor GCF (5):
    $$5x - 5 = \mathbf{5(x - 1)}$$

* **Denominator 1:** Factor by Grouping:
    $$x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3 = x^2(x + 3) - 1(x + 3) = (x^2 - 1)(x + 3) = \mathbf{(x - 1)(x + 1)(x + 3)}$$

* **Denominator 2:** Factor Trinomial (Factors of 3 that sum to 4 are 3 and 1):
    $$\mathbf{(x + 3)(x + 1)}$$

* **Determine the LCD:** The LCD includes all unique factors from both denominators:
    $$\mathbf{LCD = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x + 3)}$$

---

#### 2. Simplify the First Fraction

Notice that the numerator and denominator of the first fraction share a factor of $(x - 1)$. We simplify it *before* finding the common denominator.

$$\frac{5\cancel{(x - 1)}}{\cancel{(x - 1)}(x + 1)(x + 3)} = \frac{5}{(x + 1)(x + 3)}$$

The problem is now:
$$\frac{5}{(x + 1)(x + 3)} - \frac{2x + 7}{(x + 3)(x + 1)}$$

---

#### 3. Rewrite Fractions with the LCD

* **LCD Check:** The denominators are now identical: **$(x + 1)(x + 3)$**. No further multiplication is required.

---

#### 4. Combine the Numerators (Subtract!)

Subtract the numerators over the common denominator. **Crucially, the entire second numerator $(2x + 7)$ must be placed in parentheses and subtracted.**

$$\frac{5 - (2x + 7)}{(x + 1)(x + 3)}$$

---

#### 5. Simplify the Final Numerator

Distribute the negative sign and combine like terms:

$$5 - 2x - 7 = -2x - 2$$

Now, factor the numerator to check for final cancellations:
$$-2x - 2 = \mathbf{-2(x + 1)}$$

---

#### 6. Final Cancellation

Substitute the factored numerator back into the expression and cancel the remaining common factor $(x + 1)$.

$$\frac{-2\cancel{(x + 1)}}{\cancel{(x + 1)}(x + 3)}$$

#### 7. Final Answer

$$\mathbf{\frac{-2}{x + 3}}$$

- **Complex Fraction** = A fraction within a fraction (we heard you like fractions)
- **Main Division** = the main bar dividing the fractions 
- *2 Ways to find the solutions* :
  1) Do the numerator and denominator seperately
  2) Find a common LCD for all fractions involved(generally faster method) - What you are trying to do, is during the multiplication phase, find all the prime factors required to cancel out the denominators so you are only left with the numerators multiplied by what is remaining, so you need to multiply by every value that is a prime factor in the denominator at least once, it's not actually that you are trying to find a LCD to make all the denominators the same(like when adding or subtracting a rational expression), you are trying to cancel the denominator altogether, and what you do to the denominator bottom, you do to the top on the numerator - so you cancel the bottom, and with what remains you multiply it by the numerator
- **LCD** = Lowest Common Denominator = The smallest number that can be found to fit all the denominators
- The largets number of repeats on any part of the LCD 
### ➗ Solving a Complex Fraction: $\frac{\frac{25}{9} + \frac{25}{3}}{10}$

---

#### 1. Simplify the Numerator (Addition)

The numerator is $\frac{25}{9} + \frac{25}{3}$. The Least Common Denominator (LCD) for 9 and 3 is **9**.

* Rewrite the second fraction with the LCD:
    $$\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{75}{9}$$
* Add the fractions:
    $$\frac{25}{9} + \frac{75}{9} = \frac{25 + 75}{9} = \mathbf{\frac{100}{9}}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite the Complex Fraction as Division

Now we substitute the simplified numerator back into the complex fraction:

$$\frac{\frac{100}{9}}{10} = \frac{100}{9} \div 10$$

* Rewrite the whole number 10 as a fraction:
    $$\frac{100}{9} \div \frac{10}{1}$$

---

#### 3. Perform the Division

To divide, we use **Keep-Change-Flip** (multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction).

$$\frac{100}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{10}$$

* Cancel the common factor of 10 between 100 and 10:
    $$\frac{100^{\div 10}}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{10^{\div 10}} = \frac{10}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{1}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

$$\mathbf{\frac{10}{9}}$$
### ➗ Solving a Complex Fraction: $\frac{\frac{x^2}{5} + \frac{25}{xy + 2x}}{\frac{25}{x^2}}$

---

#### 1. Simplify the Numerator (Addition)

The numerator is $\frac{x^2}{5} + \frac{25}{xy + 2x}$.

* **Factor Denominator 2:** $xy + 2x = \mathbf{x(y + 2)}$
* **LCD:** The LCD for $5$ and $x(y + 2)$ is $\mathbf{5x(y + 2)}$.

* **Rewrite and Add Fractions:**
    $$\frac{x^2}{5} \cdot \frac{x(y + 2)}{x(y + 2)} + \frac{25}{x(y + 2)} \cdot \frac{5}{5} = \frac{x^3(y + 2) + 125}{5x(y + 2)}$$

* **Simplified Numerator:**
    $$\mathbf{\frac{x^3y + 2x^3 + 125}{5x(y + 2)}}$$

---

#### 2. Rewrite as Multiplication (Keep-Change-Flip)

The complex fraction is equivalent to the numerator multiplied by the reciprocal of the denominator ($\frac{25}{x^2}$ becomes $\frac{x^2}{25}$):

$$\frac{x^3y + 2x^3 + 125}{5x(y + 2)} \cdot \frac{x^2}{25}$$

---

#### 3. Perform the Multiplication

Multiply straight across. We can simplify the monomial terms in the denominator ($5x \cdot 25 = 125x$) and distribute the $x^2$ in the numerator.

* **Final Numerator:** $x^2(x^3y + 2x^3 + 125) = \mathbf{x^5y + 2x^5 + 125x^2}$
* **Final Denominator:** $125x(y + 2) = \mathbf{125xy + 250x}$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

$$\mathbf{\frac{x^5y + 2x^5 + 125x^2}{125x(y + 2)}}$$
### ➗ Solving a Complex Fraction (LCD Method) ($\frac{\frac{y + 3}{x + 6} - \frac{y + 3}{x - 5}}{\frac{3}{x - 5} - \frac{y + 3}{x + 6}}$)

**Problem:**
$$\frac{\frac{y + 3}{x + 6} - \frac{y + 3}{x - 5}}{\frac{3}{x - 5} - \frac{y + 3}{x + 6}}$$

---

#### 1. Determine the Overall LCD

The denominators in all four simple fractions are $(x + 6)$, $(x - 5)$, and $(y + 3)$ (in the numerators). We only consider the **denominators** of the simple fractions when finding the LCD for the entire expression.

* **Simple Denominators:** $(x + 6)$, $(x - 5)$
* **Overall LCD:** $\mathbf{(x + 6)(x - 5)}$

---

#### 2. Multiply Numerator and Denominator by the LCD

Multiply the main numerator and the main denominator of the complex fraction by the Overall LCD:

$$\frac{\left(\frac{y + 3}{x + 6} - \frac{y + 3}{x - 5}\right) \cdot (x + 6)(x - 5)}{\left(\frac{3}{x - 5} - \frac{y + 3}{x + 6}\right) \cdot (x + 6)(x - 5)}$$

---

#### 3. Simplify the Numerator

Distribute the LCD across the two terms in the numerator:

$$\frac{y + 3}{\cancel{x + 6}} \cdot \cancel{(x + 6)}(x - 5) - \frac{y + 3}{\cancel{x - 5}} \cdot (x + 6)\cancel{(x - 5)}$$

$$= (y + 3)(x - 5) - (y + 3)(x + 6)$$

* **Factor out the common term** $(y + 3)$:
$$(y + 3) [ (x - 5) - (x + 6) ]$$

* **Simplify the inner bracket:** $x - 5 - x - 6 = \mathbf{-11}$
* **Simplified Numerator:** $\mathbf{-11(y + 3)}$

---

#### 4. Simplify the Denominator

Distribute the LCD across the two terms in the denominator:

$$\frac{3}{\cancel{x - 5}} \cdot (x + 6)\cancel{(x - 5)} - \frac{y + 3}{\cancel{x + 6}} \cdot \cancel{(x + 6)}(x - 5)$$

$$= 3(x + 6) - (y + 3)(x - 5)$$

* **Expand:** $3x + 18 - (xy - 5y + 3x - 15)$
* **Apply the negative sign:** $3x + 18 - xy + 5y - 3x + 15$
* **Combine like terms** ($3x$ and $-3x$ cancel):
* **Simplified Denominator:** $\mathbf{5y - xy + 33}$

---

#### 5. Final Answer

Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:

$$\mathbf{\frac{-11(y + 3)}{5y - xy + 33}}$$
### ➗ Solving a Complex Fraction (LCD Method) ($\frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{5}{y + 7}}{\frac{x - 6}{9} + \frac{x - 6}{3y + 21}}$)

**Problem:**
$$\frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{5}{y + 7}}{\frac{x - 6}{9} + \frac{x - 6}{3y + 21}}$$

---

#### 1. Determine the Overall LCD

First, factor all unique denominators in the simple fractions:
* $y + 7$
* $9$
* $3y + 21 = \mathbf{3(y + 7)}$
* The set of denominators is: $\{3, (y+7), 9, 3(y+7)\}$
* The **Overall LCD** must contain the numerical factor 9 and the binomial factor $(y + 7)$:
    $$\mathbf{LCD = 9(y + 7)}$$

---

#### 2. Multiply Numerator and Denominator by the LCD

Multiply the entire main numerator and the entire main denominator by the Overall LCD, $9(y + 7)$.

$$\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{5}{y + 7}\right) \cdot 9(y + 7)}{\left(\frac{x - 6}{9} + \frac{x - 6}{3(y + 7)}\right) \cdot 9(y + 7)}$$

---

#### 3. Simplify the Numerator

Distribute $9(y + 7)$ across the two terms in the numerator:

* Term 1: $\frac{1}{\cancel{3}} \cdot \cancel{9}^3 (y + 7) = 3(y + 7)$
* Term 2: $\frac{5}{\cancel{y + 7}} \cdot 9 \cancel{(y + 7)} = 45$

* **Combined Numerator:** $3(y + 7) + 45 = 3y + 21 + 45 = \mathbf{3y + 66}$

---

#### 4. Simplify the Denominator

Distribute $9(y + 7)$ across the two terms in the denominator:

* Term 1: $\frac{x - 6}{\cancel{9}} \cdot \cancel{9}(y + 7) = (x - 6)(y + 7)$
* Term 2: $\frac{x - 6}{\cancel{3(y + 7)}} \cdot \cancel{9}^3 \cancel{(y + 7)} = 3(x - 6)$

* **Combined Denominator:** $(x - 6)(y + 7) + 3(x - 6)$
* **Factor out the common term** $(x - 6)$:
    $$(x - 6) [ (y + 7) + 3 ]$$
* **Simplify the inner bracket:** $y + 7 + 3 = \mathbf{y + 10}$
* **Simplified Denominator:** $\mathbf{(x - 6)(y + 10)}$

---

#### 5. Factor the Numerator for Final Simplification

Factor the simplified numerator:
$$3y + 66 = \mathbf{3(y + 22)}$$

---

#### 6. Final Answer

Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:

$$\mathbf{\frac{3(y + 22)}{(x - 6)(y + 10)}}$$

- When solving a linear equation with fractions, we are able to clear the fractions by multiplying bothsides by the LCD of all denominators
- We must think closely about *restriced values*. We must check our solution(s) to ensure we do not end up with a denominator of 0.
### 📝 Solving a Rational Equation: $\frac{1}{m + 5} + \frac{1}{m^2 + 5m} = \frac{4}{m^2 + 5m}$

---

#### 1. Factor All Denominators and Find the LCD

* **Denominator 1:** $\mathbf{m + 5}$
* **Denominator 2:** $m^2 + 5m = \mathbf{m(m + 5)}$
* **Denominator 3:** $m^2 + 5m = \mathbf{m(m + 5)}$
* **Least Common Denominator (LCD):** $\mathbf{m(m + 5)}$

---

#### 2. Identify Excluded Values

The denominators cannot be zero. We set the factors of the LCD equal to zero and solve:
* $m \neq 0$
* $m + 5 \neq 0 \implies m \neq -5$
* **Excluded Values:** $\mathbf{m \neq 0, -5}$

---

#### 3. Clear the Denominators by Multiplying by the LCD

Multiply every term on both sides of the equation by the LCD, $m(m + 5)$.

$$m(m + 5) \cdot \frac{1}{m + 5} + m(m + 5) \cdot \frac{1}{m(m + 5)} = m(m + 5) \cdot \frac{4}{m(m + 5)}$$

* **Cancel the denominators:**
    $$m(1) + 1 = 4$$

---

#### 4. Solve the Linear Equation

The resulting equation is a simple linear equation:

$$m + 1 = 4$$

* Subtract 1 from both sides:
    $$m = 4 - 1$$
    $$\mathbf{m = 3}$$

---

#### 5. Check the Solution

We compare the solution to the excluded values ($m \neq 0, -5$).
Since $m = 3$ is not one of the excluded values, it is a valid solution.

$$\mathbf{Solution: m = 3}$$

* **Denominator 1:** $x^2 - 16$ (Difference of Squares)
    $$\mathbf{(x - 4)(x + 4)}$$
* **Denominator 2:** $\mathbf{x + 4}$

* **Excluded Values:** $\mathbf{x \neq 4, -4}$

---

#### 3. Clear the Denominators by Multiplying by the LCD

Multiply every term on both sides of the equation by the LCD, $(x - 4)(x + 4)$.

---

#### 4. Simplify and Solve the Resulting Equation

* **Simplify:**
    $$x^2 + x - 2 + x^2 - 4x = x + 4$$

* **Combine like terms (LHS):**
    $$(x^2 + x^2) + (x - 4x) - 2 = x + 4$$
    $$2x^2 - 3x - 2 = x + 4$$

* **Set the equation to zero (Quadratic Form):**
    $$2x^2 - 3x - x - 2 - 4 = 0$$
    $$\mathbf{2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0}$$

* **Divide by 2 to simplify:**
    $$x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$$

* **Factor the quadratic:** (Factors of -3 that sum to -2 are -3 and 1)
    $$(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$$

* **Possible Solutions:**
    $$x - 3 = 0 \implies \mathbf{x = 3}$$
    $$x + 1 = 0 \implies \mathbf{x = -1}$$

---

#### 5. Check the Solutions

We compare the solutions to the excluded values ($x \neq 4, -4$).
Both $x = 3$ and $x = -1$ are valid solutions.

$$\mathbf{Solutions: x = 3, -1}$$
### 📝 Solving a Rational Equation: $\frac{1}{b^3 + 5b^2 + 6b} + \frac{1}{b + 2} = \frac{1}{2b^2 + 10b + 12}$

---

#### 1. Factor All Denominators and Find the LCD

* **Denominator 1:** Factor out GCF ($b$), then factor the quadratic ($b^2 + 5b + 6 = (b+3)(b+2)$):
    $$b^3 + 5b^2 + 6b = \mathbf{b(b + 3)(b + 2)}$$
* **Denominator 2:** $\mathbf{b + 2}$
* **Denominator 3:** Factor out GCF (2), then factor the quadratic ($b^2 + 5b + 6 = (b+3)(b+2)$):
    $$2b^2 + 10b + 12 = 2(b^2 + 5b + 6) = \mathbf{2(b + 3)(b + 2)}$$

* **Least Common Denominator (LCD):** The LCD must include all unique factors: $2$, $b$, $(b + 3)$, and $(b + 2)$.
    $$\mathbf{LCD = 2b(b + 3)(b + 2)}$$

---

#### 2. Identify Excluded Values

Set the factors of the LCD equal to zero to find values that make the denominators undefined:
* $2b \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{b \neq 0}$
* $b + 3 \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{b \neq -3}$
* $b + 2 \neq 0 \implies \mathbf{b \neq -2}$

---

#### 3. Clear the Denominators by Multiplying by the LCD

Multiply every term by the LCD, $2b(b + 3)(b + 2)$.

* **Term 1:** $\cancel{2b(b + 3)(b + 2)} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{b(b + 3)(b + 2)}} = 2$
* **Term 2:** $2b(b + 3)\cancel{(b + 2)} \cdot \frac{1}{\cancel{b + 2}} = 2b(b + 3)$

    $$2b^2 + 6b - b + 2 = 0$$
    $$\mathbf{2b^2 + 5b + 2 = 0}$$

* **Factor the quadratic:** (Look for factors of $a \cdot c = 4$ that sum to $b = 5$: 4 and 1)
    $$2b^2 + 4b + 1b + 2 = 0$$
    $$2b(b + 2) + 1(b + 2) = 0$$
    $$\mathbf{(2b + 1)(b + 2) = 0}$$

* **Possible Solutions (Zero Product Property):**
    $$2b + 1 = 0 \implies 2b = -1 \implies \mathbf{b = -\frac{1}{2}}$$
    $$b + 2 = 0 \implies \mathbf{b = -2}$$

---

#### 5. Check the Solutions

We compare the possible solutions to the excluded values ($b \neq 0, -3, -2$).

* $b = -\frac{1}{2}$ is **valid**.
* $b = -2$ is an **excluded value** (it makes the original denominators zero), so this is an **extraneous solution** and must be rejected.

### 🛶 Rational Equation Word Problem: Boat Speed

**Problem:**
A river boat travels 75 miles against the current in the same amount of time as it goes 125 miles with the current. If the speed of the current is 5 mph, what is 
\the speed of the boat in still water?

---

#### 1. Define Variables and Rates

We use the relationship: $\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$. The key condition is $\mathbf{T_{\text{Upstream}} = T_{\text{Downstream}}}$.

* Let $\mathbf{x}$ be the speed of the boat in still water (mph).
* Current speed is $5$ mph.
* **Rate Upstream (Against Current):** $x - 5$
* **Rate Downstream (With Current):** $x + 5$
* **Distance Upstream:** $75$ miles
* **Distance Downstream:** $125$ miles

---

#### 2. Set Up and Solve the Rational Equation

Set the time expressions equal to each other:
$$\frac{75}{x - 5} = \frac{125}{x + 5}$$

* **Cross-Multiply:**
    $$75(x + 5) = 125(x - 5)$$

* **Distribute:**
    $$75x + 375 = 125x - 625$$

* **Solve for x (Isolate x):**
    $$375 + 625 = 125x - 75x$$
    $$1000 = 50x$$

* **Final Calculation:**
    $$x = \frac{1000}{50}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 20}$$

---

#### 3. Final Answer

The speed of the boat in still water is **20 mph**.
### 🚗 Rational Expression Word Problem: Distance, Rate, Time

**Problem:**
Jeff traveled to his parent's house by car. On the trip there, he averaged 80 mph. On the trip back, due to road construction, he only averaged 50 mph. If he spent 9 more hours driving on the way back, what was the total distance to his parent's house?

**Goal:** Find the total distance to his parent's house, $\mathbf{D}$.

---

#### 1. Define Variables and Time Expressions

The core relationship is that the time back ($T_{\text{back}}$) was 9 hours longer than the time there ($T_{\text{there}}$).
$$\mathbf{T_{\text{back}} = T_{\text{there}} + 9}$$

We use the formula $T = \frac{D}{R}$ (Time = Distance / Rate).

* Let $\mathbf{D}$ be the distance to the parents' house (miles).
* **Time There ($T_{\text{there}}$):** $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate There}} = \frac{D}{80}$
* **Time Back ($T_{\text{back}}$):** $\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate Back}} = \frac{D}{50}$

---

#### 2. Set Up the Rational Equation

Substitute the time expressions into the core relationship:

$$\mathbf{\frac{D}{50} = \frac{D}{80} + 9}$$

---

#### 3. Solve the Equation using the LCD Method

* **Find the LCD:** The LCD of 50, 80, and 1 is 400.
* **Multiply every term by 400:**
    $$400 \cdot \frac{D}{50} = 400 \cdot \frac{D}{80} + 400 \cdot 9$$

* **Simplify and clear denominators:**
    $$8D = 5D + 3600$$

* **Isolate the D term (Subtract 5D from both sides):**
    $$8D - 5D = 3600$$
    $$3D = 3600$$

* **Solve for D (Divide by 3):**
    $$D = \frac{3600}{3}$$
    $$\mathbf{D = 1200}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

The total distance to his parent's house is **1,200 miles**.

### 👷 Work Rate Word Problem: Combined Time

**Problem:**
It takes Cody 9 hours to tar a roof. Trevor can tar the same roof in 5 hours. If they work together, how long would it take them?

**Goal:** Find the time it takes them to complete the job together, $\mathbf{t}$.

---

#### 1. Define Individual Work Rates

A work rate is expressed as $\frac{\text{1 job}}{\text{Time}}$.

* Let $t$ be the time it takes them to complete the job together (hours).
* **Cody's Rate ($R_C$):** $\frac{1}{9}$ job per hour.
* **Trevor's Rate ($R_T$):** $\frac{1}{5}$ job per hour.
* **Combined Rate ($R_{\text{combined}}$):** $\frac{1}{t}$ job per hour.

---

#### 2. Set Up the Rational Equation

The sum of their individual rates equals their combined rate:
$$R_C + R_T = R_{\text{combined}}$$

$$\mathbf{\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{t}}$$

---

#### 3. Solve the Equation using the LCD Method

* **Find the LCD:** The LCD of 9, 5, and $t$ is $9 \cdot 5 \cdot t = \mathbf{45t}$.
* **Multiply every term by $45t$:**

$$45t \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 45t \cdot \frac{1}{5} = 45t \cdot \frac{1}{t}$$

* **Simplify and clear denominators:**
    $$5t + 9t = 45$$

* **Combine like terms:**
    $$14t = 45$$

* **Solve for t:**
    $$t = \frac{45}{14}$$

* **Convert to a Mixed Number (Optional for context):**
    $$t = 3\frac{3}{14} \text{ hours}$$

---

#### 4. Final Answer

It would take them $\mathbf{\frac{45}{14}}$ hours (or approximately $3.21$ hours) to tar the roof together.
## Algebra II - Lesson 54 - Radical Expression - 15November2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=23h13m45s
- Recall that the square root of a number (q) is any number that when multiplied by itself gives us the number (q) back. 4 x 4 = 16, 16 is a perfect square. 
- The square root of 16 can be '4' or NEGATIVE '-4', both will work.
- **Principal Square Root** = $\sqrt{16}$ = 4  The positive square root
- $-\sqrt{16}$ = -4 : put a 'negative' sign in front of the square root to let them know
   you want the negative 
- $\pm\sqrt{25}$  = $\pm5$  : +-  plus or minus sign, could be both possibilities
- $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ : The notation $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ is used to define the $\mathbf{n}$-th root of $a$. 
- If $n$ is even and $a \ge 0$ (a is not a negative value) you will have 2 sets of notation, *principal* and *negative* 
- If $n$ is even and $a < 0$ (a is a negative value) will be *not a real number* (THAT NUMBER IS NOT REAL!)
- If $n$ is odd : You will only have one root, since it is allowed to be negative. The radicand is allowed to be negative for an odd higher power index.  $\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{-8}}$ = $-2 \cdot -2 \cdot -2 = 8$
- **Radical Symbol ($\sqrt{}$):** The symbol used to denote a root. 
* **Index ($\mathbf{n}$):** or **Order** : The small number placed above and to the left of the radical symbol. It indicates which root you are taking (e.g., $n=3$ for cube root, $n=4$ for fourth root). If no number is shown (like in $\sqrt{a}$), the index is implicitly 2 (square root).
* **Radicand ($\mathbf{a}$):** The number or expression written inside the radical symbol.
- $\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{8}}$ : what multiplied by itself 3 times gives 8? $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$
- $\mathbf{\sqrt[2]{a}}$ If the index isn't shown, it's assumed to be '2' 
- $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a^n}}$ : If $n$ is even and $n > 0$ then you get the absolute value of  | a |, a negative will turn into a positive. - The powers/index will cancel eachother 
- $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a^n}}$ : If $n$ is odd and $n > 0$ : $n$ will cancel eachother out and you are left with $a$ - if  'a' is negative, an odd number of exponents will give you a negative 
- $a^1/n$ = $\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ : **Fractional Exponents** or **Rational Exponents** : 'a' raised to the power of 1 over 'n' is equal to the 'n'th root of 'a'  - the 'n'  of the exponent becomes the index
- $4^1/2$ = $\mathbf{\sqrt[2]{4}}$ : '4' raised to the one over 2 power is the same as the square root of 4
- $a^m/n$ = ($\mathbf{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ )$^m$ : they are the same, 'a' to the power of 'm/n' is the same as the square root of 'a' raised to the power 'm' -  *The Denominator becomes the index* - *The numerator becomes the power you raise that result to afterwards*
- $x^-1$ = $\frac {1}{x}$    If you raise a number to the power of negative one, it simply wants the reciprocal of that number under '1' 
### ➗ Simplifying Rational Exponents: Quotient Rule

**Problem:**
$$\frac{5^{5/3}}{5^{2/3}}$$

---

#### 1. Apply the Quotient Rule for Exponents

When dividing powers with the same base, you **keep the base** and **subtract the exponents**.
$$\mathbf{\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}}$$

Applying this rule to the problem:
$$5^{5/3 - 2/3}$$

---

#### 2. Perform Subtraction on the Fractional Exponents

Since the denominators are already the same, we can subtract the numerators directly.

$$\text{Exponent} = \frac{5}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5 - 2}{3} = \frac{3}{3}$$

$$\frac{3}{3} = \mathbf{1}$$

When multiplying powers with the same base, you **keep the base** and **add the exponents**.
$$\mathbf{a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}}$$

* **Add the fractional exponents in the denominator:**
    $$\text{Exponent Sum} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}$$
    $$\text{Exponent Sum} = \frac{1 + 2 + 1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$$

* **Subtract the exponents:**
    $$m^{2 - 4/3}$$

---

#### 3. Perform Subtraction of Exponents

To subtract, we need a common denominator. Rewrite $2$ as a fraction with a denominator of 3: $2 = \frac{6}{3}$.

$$\text{Exponent} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6 - 4}{3} = \mathbf{\frac{2}{3}}$$

---

#### 4. Final Simplified Result

The simplified expression is:

### 📐 Exponential Expression Simplification 

---

#### Problem

Simplify the expression:

$$\frac{(m^3)^2 \cdot m^2}{m^{1/2}}$$

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Power of a Power
Apply the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{b \cdot c}$ to the first term, $(m^3)^2$:
$$(m^3)^2 = m^{3 \times 2} = m^6$$

The expression becomes:
$$\frac{m^6 \cdot m^2}{m^{1/2}}$$

##### 2. Product Rule (Numerator)
Apply the rule $a^b \cdot a^c = a^{b+c}$ to the numerator $m^6 \cdot m^2$:
$$m^6 \cdot m^2 = m^{6+2} = m^8$$

The expression becomes:
$$\frac{m^8}{m^{1/2}}$$

##### 3. Quotient Rule
Apply the rule $\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}$ to the fraction:
$$\frac{m^8}{m^{1/2}} = m^{8 - 1/2}$$

##### 4. Final Exponent Calculation
Calculate the exponent $8 - \frac{1}{2}$:
$$8 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{15}{2}$$

---

#### Final Simplified Answer

The result is:
$$m^{15/2}$$
### 📝 Exponential Expression Simplification

---

#### Problem

Simplify the expression:

$$\frac{(x^2)^{2/3} \cdot x^{1/2}}{x^{-3/2}}$$

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Power of a Power (Numerator)

First, apply the rule $(a^b)^c = a^{b \cdot c}$:
$$(x^2)^{2/3} = x^{2 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = x^{4/3}$$

The expression becomes:
$$\frac{x^{4/3} \cdot x^{1/2}}{x^{-3/2}}$$

##### 2. Product Rule (Numerator)

Next, apply the rule $a^b \cdot a^c = a^{b+c}$. We must add the exponents $\frac{4}{3} + \frac{1}{2}$ using a common denominator of 6:
$$\frac{4}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{8}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{11}{6}$$

The numerator simplifies to $x^{11/6}$, and the expression becomes:
$$\frac{x^{11/6}}{x^{-3/2}}$$

##### 3. Quotient Rule

Apply the rule $\frac{a^b}{a^c} = a^{b-c}$. Remember that subtracting a negative exponent is equivalent to adding a positive one:
$$x^{\frac{11}{6} - (-\frac{3}{2})} = x^{\frac{11}{6} + \frac{3}{2}}$$

##### 4. Final Exponent Calculation

Add the exponents $\frac{11}{6} + \frac{3}{2}$ using a common denominator of 6:
$$\frac{11}{6} + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{11}{6} + \frac{3 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{11}{6} + \frac{9}{6} = \frac{20}{6}$$

Reduce the fraction: $\frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3}$.

---

#### Final Simplified Answer

The simplified expression is:
$$x^{10/3}$$
## Algebra II - Lesson 55 - Simplifying Radicals - 16November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=23h47m40s
- **Product Rule For Radicals** : $\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{a \cdot b}$ : allows you to combine or separate radicals that have the exact same **index** (the type of root, e.g., square root, cube root). This rule is crucial for both multiplying expressions and simplifying single radicals.
- **Quotient Rule ForRadicals** : $\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$ : It is easier to use the Quotient Rule for $\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$ because calculating $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{4}}$ directly yields $\frac{1}{2}$ without needing to recognize or calculate the decimal or fractional square root of $0.25$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.
- **Simplified Radical** : 
  1) The Radicand contains no factor that is raised to a power which is greater than or equal to the index - To simplify $\sqrt{20}$, we use the Product Rule for Radicals to factor out the largest perfect square factor, which is 4, resulting in $\sqrt{4 \cdot 5}$, which simplifies to $2\sqrt{5}$.
  2) The Radicand has no fractions - To simplify $\sqrt{\frac{5}{36}}$, we apply the Quotient Rule for Radicals to separate it into $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{36}}$, which then simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{6}$.
  3) No denominator contains a Radical - use the process of **Rationalising the Denominator** to fix
  4) There can be no common factor between the index of the radical and the exponent of the radicand - The radical $\sqrt[4]{4^2}$ (the fourth root of 4 to the power of 2) violates the principle, as it can be simplified because the **index (4) and the exponent of the radicand (2) share a common factor of 2**, allowing the radical to be rewritten as $\sqrt{4}$, which evaluates to 2.
-  **Rationalising the Denominator** : To rationalize the denominator in $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we **multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$** to eliminate the radical in the denominator, resulting in the simplified equivalent fraction $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
### 🧮 Product Rules for Radicals

The **Product Rule for Radicals** allows you to combine or separate radicals that have the exact same **index** (the type of root, e.g., square root, cube root). This rule is crucial for both multiplying expressions and simplifying single radicals.

---

#### 1. Multiplication Rule (Combining Radicals)

This is used to multiply two radicals with the same index $n$.

**Formula:**
$$\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{a \cdot b}$$

**Explanation:**
You can multiply the **radicands** (the values under the radical sign) and place the result under a single radical sign, as long as the index $n$ is identical for all terms.

**Example (Square Root, $n=2$):**
$$\sqrt{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{8 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} = 4$$

**Example (Cube Root, $n=3$):**
$$\sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \sqrt[3]{16} = \sqrt[3]{4 \cdot 16} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4$$

---

#### 2. Separation Rule (Simplifying Radicals)

This is the reverse application, used to break a single radical into a product of two or more radicals for **simplification**.

**Formula:**
$$\sqrt[n]{a \cdot b} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$$

**Explanation:**
To simplify a radical like $\sqrt[n]{x}$, you must factor $x$ into $a \cdot b$, where $a$ is the largest possible **perfect $n^{th}$ power**. This allows $\sqrt[n]{a}$ to be evaluated, leaving the rest under the radical $\sqrt[n]{b}$.

**Example (Simplifying $\sqrt{45}$):**
1. Factor 45 using the largest perfect square (9):
   $$\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5}$$
2. Separate the factors:
   $$\sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5}$$
3. Evaluate the perfect square:
   $$\sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}$$

---

#### 🔑 Summary of Key Usage

The ability to move between the combined form ($\sqrt[n]{ab}$) and the separated form ($\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$) is what makes the product rule fundamental to working with radicals.

### ➗ Quotient Rule for Radicals

The **Quotient Rule for Radicals** is used when dealing with the division of radical expressions that share the same **index** ($n$). It allows you to move between a single radical covering a fraction and a fraction made of two separate radicals.

---

#### Formal Definition and Formula

The rule states that the $n^{th}$ root of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the $n^{th}$ roots.

**Formula:**
$$\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$$

* **Condition:** The index $n$ must be the same for the numerator and denominator. The value $b$ cannot be zero.

#### Two Main Applications

The Quotient Rule is primarily used in two ways to simplify expressions:

##### 1. Separation (Simplifying a Fraction Under a Radical)

You use this when a fraction is already entirely under a single radical sign. Separating it allows you to simplify the numerator and denominator independently.

* **When to Use:** When the radicands (numerator $a$ and denominator $b$) are perfect $n^{th}$ powers or contain factors that are perfect $n^{th}$ powers.

* **Example:** Simplify $\sqrt{\frac{81}{49}}$
    $$\sqrt{\frac{81}{49}} = \frac{\sqrt{81}}{\sqrt{49}} = \frac{9}{7}$$

##### 2. Combination (Dividing Two Radicals)

You use this when you have a fraction composed of a radical in the numerator and a radical in the denominator. Combining them allows you to simplify the fraction inside the radical before taking the root.

* **When to Use:** When the radicands form a fraction that is easy to reduce, or when the quotient of the radicands is a perfect $n^{th}$ power.

* **Example:** Simplify $\frac{\sqrt[3]{16}}{\sqrt[3]{2}}$
    $$\frac{\sqrt[3]{16}}{\sqrt[3]{2}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{16}{2}} = \sqrt[3]{8}$$
* **Final Result:** $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$

---

#### 💡 Requirement for Simplification

A radical expression is **not** considered fully simplified if:

* It has a **fraction** inside the radical ($\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}}$).
* It has a **radical** in the denominator ($\frac{a}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$).

The Quotient Rule is the first step in addressing these issues, often followed by **rationalizing the denominator** to satisfy the second rule.
### ➗ Simplifying Radical Multiplication ($\sqrt[7]{20x^3} \cdot \sqrt[7]{10x}$)

---

#### Problem

Simplify the following expression:

$$\sqrt[7]{20x^3} \cdot \sqrt[7]{10x}$$

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Combine Radicals (Product Rule)

Since both radicals have the same index ($n=7$), we can use the **Multiplication Rule** $\sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{a \cdot b}$ to combine them under a single radical:

$$\sqrt[7]{20x^3 \cdot 10x}$$

Multiply the terms inside the radical:
* **Coefficients:** $20 \cdot 10 = 200$
* **Variables:** $x^3 \cdot x = x^{3+1} = x^4$

The expression is now:
$$\sqrt[7]{200x^4}$$

##### 2. Simplify the Radical

To simplify, we look for **perfect $7^{th}$ power factors** within $200x^4$.

* **Variable term $x^4$:** Since $4$ is less than the index $7$, $x^4$ cannot be simplified further.
* **Coefficient term $200$:** We check for perfect $7^{th}$ powers that divide 200.
    * $1^7 = 1$
    * $2^7 = 128$
    * $3^7 = 2187$ (Too large)

Since $128$ is the largest perfect $7^{th}$ power less than 200, we can rewrite $200$ as $128 \cdot \frac{200}{128} \approx 128 \cdot 1.56$. Since the division does not result in a whole number, **128 is not a factor of 200**.

Since no perfect $7^{th}$ powers (other than 1) are factors of 200, the coefficient cannot be simplified.

---

#### Final Simplified Answer

The expression is already in its simplest form after multiplication:
$$\sqrt[7]{200x^4}$$

$$\sqrt{\frac{7}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{25}}$$

##### 2. Simplify the Denominator

Evaluate the square root in the denominator:
$$\sqrt{25} = 5$$

##### 3. Final Simplified Answer

The numerator $\sqrt{7}$ cannot be simplified further as 7 has no perfect square factors (other than 1). Combining the terms yields the final result:
$$\frac{\sqrt{7}}{5}$$
### ➗ Quotient Rule Solution ($\sqrt[3]{\frac{8}{216}}$)

$$\sqrt[3]{\frac{8}{216}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{8}}{\sqrt[3]{216}}$$

##### 2. Evaluate the Numerator

Find the cube root of 8:
$$\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \quad (\text{since } 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8)$$

##### 3. Evaluate the Denominator

Find the cube root of 216:
$$\sqrt[3]{216} = 6 \quad (\text{since } 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216)$$

##### 4. Reduce the Final Fraction

Substitute the simplified roots back into the fraction and reduce:
$$\frac{\sqrt[3]{8}}{\sqrt[3]{216}} = \frac{2}{6}$$

Reduce the fraction $\frac{2}{6}$ by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:
$$\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$$

---

#### Final Simplified Answer

The expression $\sqrt[3]{\frac{8}{216}}$ simplifies and reduces to:

$$\sqrt[5]{\frac{-1}{32}} = \frac{\sqrt[5]{-1}}{\sqrt[5]{32}}$$

##### 2. Evaluate the Numerator

Since the index ($n=5$) is **odd**, the fifth root of a negative number is defined and negative:
$$\sqrt[5]{-1} = -1$$

##### 3. Evaluate the Denominator

Find the fifth root of 32:
$$\sqrt[5]{32} = 2$$

##### 4. Final Answer

Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:

A radical expression $\sqrt[n]{x^m}$ can be rewritten as an expression with a fractional exponent $x^{m/n}$.

In this case, the index ($n$) is 4 and the exponent ($m$) is 2:

$$\sqrt[4]{x^2} = x^{2/4}$$

##### 2. Reduce the Fractional Exponent

The index ($n$) is 20 and the exponent ($m$) is 5:

$$\sqrt[20]{y^5} = y^{5/20}$$

##### 2. Reduce the Fractional Exponent

Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) between the numerator (5) and the denominator (20), which is 5. Divide both parts of the fraction by 5:

$$\frac{5}{20} = \frac{5 \div 5}{20 \div 5} = \frac{1}{4}$$

So, the expression becomes:
$$y^{1/4}$$

##### 3. Convert Back to Radical Form

- **Pythagorean Theorem** = $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ : 'c' is *hypoteneuse* Only works on right triangles (90 degrees corner)
- One Method to get the distance between 2 points : Get 2 points as ordered pairs (x, y), create a right hand triangle, take an 'x' value from one of the ordered pairs, and take a 'y' value from the other to get the corner of the right hand triangle, where as the distance between the 2 points is the *hypoteneuse*, use absolute values(you dont want a negative distance) to get the distance of the 'x' and the 'y' from your newly created corner of triangle for 'a' and 'b'
- **Distance Formula** = $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ : The Distance Formula is derived from the **Pythagorean Theorem** and is used to find the length, $d$, of the straight line segment between any two points in a Cartesian coordinate system, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. - It doesn't matter what you label was $x_1, x_2$. 'd' is the *hypoteneuse* 
### 📏 The Distance Formula

---

#### Formula Definition

The Distance Formula is derived from the **Pythagorean Theorem** and is used to find the length, $d$, of the straight line segment between any two points in a Cartesian coordinate system, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.

#### The Formula

Given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the distance $d$ between them is:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

---

#### 💡 How to Use the Formula

1.  **Subtract the $x$-coordinates** ($x_2 - x_1$) and square the result.
2.  **Subtract the $y$-coordinates** ($y_2 - y_1$) and square the result.
3.  **Add** the two squared results together.
4.  Take the **square root** of the sum to find the distance, $d$.

- Add and subtract radical expressions using the distributive property (combine like terms - they will need to be the same *index* and *radicand*) 
- Or you can factor out the square root/radical then do addition/subtraction (multiply everything by the square root of the *radicand* to get rid of it)
- If you can further simplify and factor a square root, by pulling out a perfect square like $\sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{6}$ and then multiplying it by what you have outside the square root - You should attempt to factor before and after addition/subtraction

## Algebra II - Lesson 58 - Rationalizing the Denominator - 17November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=24h49m35s
- First thing you should do is attempt to simplify the radicals
- You don't want a radical in the denominator - To get rid of a radical in the denominator, simply multiply BOTH the numerator and denominator by that radical $\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{4} = 2$ 
- You are allowed to have a numerator that contains a radical
- When you multiply a radical by a radical with the same integer, it follows normal multiplication rules, so you multiply them instead of adding (like exponents)
- if you have a variable in the $\sqrt{x^2}$ you can cancel it if it has an exponent greater than 2, because what's the square root of $x^2$?  'x'
- When you multiply the numerator, don't forget to multiply everything, not just the square roots that are seperated by a '-' or '+', you need to use the distributive property
- When you cancel a $\sqrt{x}$ square root with a variable, don't forget, you aren't getting rid of it, you are just replacing it with 'x', so 'canceling' really just means removing the square root sign
- When you are multiplying a square root with another square root, you can factor and pull out during the process, for example $\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{15} = \sqrt{5} \sqrt{5} \sqrt{3}$ since 2 square roots of $\sqrt{5}$ is equal to $\sqrt{25} = 5$ you can just pull out the '5' right there and simplify

---

#### Problem

Rationalize the denominator and simplify the expression:

$$\frac{3\sqrt[3]{4r^2}}{5\sqrt[3]{25r}}$$

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Analyze the Denominator

The denominator is $5\sqrt[3]{25r}$. To rationalize, we need to multiply the radicand ($25r$) by a factor that results in a perfect cube.

* To make $25$ a perfect cube ($125 = 5^3$), we need a factor of $5$ ($25 \cdot 5 = 125$).
* To make $r$ a perfect cube ($r^3$), we need a factor of $r^2$ ($r \cdot r^2 = r^3$).

The rationalizing factor is $\sqrt[3]{5r^2}$.

##### 2. Multiply by the Rationalizing Factor

Multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt[3]{5r^2}$:

$$\frac{3\sqrt[3]{4r^2}}{5\sqrt[3]{25r}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{5r^2}}{\sqrt[3]{5r^2}}$$

##### 3. Multiply the Denominators

### 📝 Rationalizing a Fourth Root Denominator ($\frac{5\sqrt[4]{3x^4}}{3\sqrt[4]{75x^3}}$)

---

#### Problem

Simplify the expression and rationalize the denominator:

$$\frac{5\sqrt[4]{3x^4}}{3\sqrt[4]{75x^3}}$$

#### Step-by-Step Solution

##### 1. Simplify the Numerator Radical

Factor out perfect fourth powers from the numerator's radical ($\sqrt[4]{3x^4}$):
$$\sqrt[4]{3x^4} = \sqrt[4]{x^4 \cdot 3} = x\sqrt[4]{3}$$
The numerator becomes: $5 \cdot x\sqrt[4]{3} = 5x\sqrt[4]{3}$

##### 2. Analyze the Denominator Radical

The denominator radical is $\sqrt[4]{75x^3}$. To rationalize, we need a factor that makes the radicand a perfect fourth power ($(\text{number})^4 \cdot x^4$).

* **Numerical Factor:** To make $75$ a perfect fourth power ($625 = 5^4$), we need a factor of $625/75 = 25/3$. Since we want whole numbers under the root, we look for the smallest factor to reach $625$ or $16$ or $81$. $75$ needs $75 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 / 75...$ Wait, let's stick to the base-10 perfect fourths: $16, 81, 256, 625$. $75$ is missing a factor of $75 \cdot (\text{factor})$ to reach $625$. The required factor is $625/75 = 25/3$. This is complicated. Let's use the simplest approach by ensuring the **base** of 75 becomes a fourth power.
    * $75 = 3 \cdot 5^2$. We need $3^3 \cdot 5^2$ more to make it a perfect fourth power, which is $27 \cdot 25 = 675$. $75 \cdot 675$ is complicated.

    * **Simpler Approach: Find the missing factor to reach the *next* perfect fourth power of the base 5.** $5^4 = 625$. $75 \cdot (\text{missing factor}) = 625$. $625/75$ is not an integer.
    * Let's use the prime factorization: $75 = 3^1 \cdot 5^2$. To get $3^4 \cdot 5^4$, we need $3^3 \cdot 5^2$ more. $3^3 \cdot 5^2 = 27 \cdot 25 = 675$. $75 \cdot 675 = 50625 = 15^4$. This factor is too large.

    * **Let's use the smallest factor required:**
        * $75 = 3^1 \cdot 5^2$. We need $3^3$ and $5^2$ more. The factor is $3^3 \cdot 5^2$.
        * $75 \cdot (3^3 \cdot 5^2) = (3^1 \cdot 5^2) \cdot (3^3 \cdot 5^2) = 3^4 \cdot 5^4 = (15)^4$.
        * The numerical part of the rationalizing factor is $3^3 \cdot 5^2 = 27 \cdot 25 = 675$.

* **Variable Factor:** The variable part is $x^3$. To get $x^4$, we need $x^1$ more.

The rationalizing factor is $\sqrt[4]{675x}$. (Note: This is the smallest factor to yield $15^4x^4$).

##### 3. Multiply by the Rationalizing Factor ($\sqrt[4]{675x}$)

$$\frac{5x\sqrt[4]{3}}{3\sqrt[4]{75x^3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[4]{675x}}{\sqrt[4]{675x}}$$

##### 4. Multiply the Denominators

The denominator simplifies to:
$$3 \cdot \sqrt[4]{75x^3 \cdot 675x} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[4]{50625x^4}$$
$$3 \cdot 15x = 45x$$

##### 5. Multiply the Numerators

The numerator is simplified:
$$5x \cdot \sqrt[4]{3 \cdot 675x} = 5x\sqrt[4]{2025x}$$

##### 6. Simplify the Radical in the Numerator ($5x\sqrt[4]{2025x}$)
Factor $2025$. $2025 = 81 \cdot 25 = 3^4 \cdot 5^2$.
$$5x\sqrt[4]{(81 \cdot 25)x} = 5x\sqrt[4]{3^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot x}$$
$$5x \cdot 3 \sqrt[4]{25x} = 15x\sqrt[4]{25x}$$

##### 7. Final Combined Expression

Substitute the simplified numerator and the denominator:
$$\frac{15x\sqrt[4]{25x}}{45x}$$

##### 8. Final Simplification

Cancel the common factor of $15x$ between the numerator and denominator:
$$\frac{\sqrt[4]{25x}}{3}$$

The expression is now:
$$\frac{5n\sqrt[3]{2n} + 3\sqrt[3]{3n}}{-5\sqrt[3]{6n}}$$

##### 3. Rationalize the Denominator

The denominator contains $\sqrt[3]{6n}$. To rationalize, we need a factor that makes the radicand a perfect cube ($6^3n^3$).

* **Missing Factor:** $6n$ needs $6^2n^2 = 36n^2$ more.
* **Rationalizing Factor:** $\sqrt[3]{36n^2}$.

Multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt[3]{36n^2}$:
$$\frac{5n\sqrt[3]{2n} + 3\sqrt[3]{3n}}{-5\sqrt[3]{6n}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{36n^2}}{\sqrt[3]{36n^2}}$$

##### 4. Multiply the Denominators

The denominator simplifies to a rational term:
$$-5 \cdot \sqrt[3]{6n \cdot 36n^2} = -5 \cdot \sqrt[3]{216n^3}$$
$$-5 \cdot (6n) = -30n$$

##### 5. Multiply the Numerators

$$(5n\sqrt[3]{2n}) \cdot \sqrt[3]{36n^2} + (3\sqrt[3]{3n}) \cdot \sqrt[3]{36n^2}$$
$$5n\sqrt[3]{2n \cdot 36n^2} + 3\sqrt[3]{3n \cdot 36n^2}$$
$$5n\sqrt[3]{72n^3} + 3\sqrt[3]{108n^3}$$

##### 6. Simplify the Numerator Terms

* **First Term ($5n\sqrt[3]{72n^3}$):** Factor $72 = 8 \cdot 9$ and $n^3$.
$$5n \cdot \sqrt[3]{8n^3 \cdot 9} = 5n \cdot 2n\sqrt[3]{9} = 10n^2\sqrt[3]{9}$$
* **Second Term ($3\sqrt[3]{108n^3}$):** Factor $108 = 27 \cdot 4$ and $n^3$.
$$3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{27n^3 \cdot 4} = 3 \cdot 3n\sqrt[3]{4} = 9n\sqrt[3]{4}$$

##### 7. Final Combined Expression

Substitute the simplified numerator and the denominator:
$$\frac{10n^2\sqrt[3]{9} + 9n\sqrt[3]{4}}{-30n}$$

##### 8. Simplify by Dividing All Terms by $n$

$$\frac{10n^2\sqrt[3]{9}}{-30n} + \frac{9n\sqrt[3]{4}}{-30n}$$
$$-\frac{10n}{30}\sqrt[3]{9} - \frac{9}{30}\sqrt[3]{4}$$
$$-\frac{n}{3}\sqrt[3]{9} - \frac{3}{10}\sqrt[3]{4}$$

## Algebra II - Lesson 59 - Rationalizing a Binomial Denominator - 18November2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=25h16m
- A **conjugate** =  is a pair of binomials (expressions with two terms) that are identical except for the sign connecting the two terms. If the original binomial is $a + b$, its conjugate is $a - b$. If the original binomial is $a - b$, its conjugate is $a + b$. - When you work it out, you get a difference of squares $a^2 + b^2$ where the middle terms cancel eachother out
- To clear a denominator with more than just a square root, what you need to do is multiply BOTH the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator - which will leave you with a radical free denominator
- You will want to simplify (if you can) before doing the conjugate
### 📝 Definition and Use of a Conjugate

---

#### 💡 Definition of a Conjugate

A **conjugate** is a pair of binomials (expressions with two terms) that are identical except for the sign connecting the two terms. 
* If the original binomial is $a + b$, its conjugate is $a - b$.
* If the original binomial is $a - b$, its conjugate is $a + b$.

The key property of a conjugate pair is that when multiplied together, the result is always the **difference of squares**, which eliminates the middle terms:
$$(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2 = a^2 - b^2$$

---

#### 🛠️ Application in Rationalizing Denominators

The primary use of conjugates in algebra is to **rationalize a binomial denominator** containing square roots.

Rationalizing means removing the radical from the denominator. When the denominator is a single term (e.g., $\sqrt{3}$), you multiply by that radical. When the denominator is a binomial with a radical (e.g., $2 + \sqrt{3}$), you must multiply by its conjugate to eliminate the root.

##### Example 1: Rationalizing with a Radical Conjugate

| Original Denominator | Conjugate | Product (Difference of Squares) | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $4 + \sqrt{5}$ | $4 - \sqrt{5}$ | $(4)^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2$ | $16 - 5 = 11$ |
| $3\sqrt{2} - 7$ | $3\sqrt{2} + 7$ | $(3\sqrt{2})^2 - (7)^2$ | $18 - 49 = -31$ |

##### Step-by-Step Example

**Problem:** Rationalize the denominator of the expression $\frac{10}{2 - \sqrt{3}}$.

| Step | Action | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Identify Conjugate** | The denominator is $2 - \sqrt{3}$. The conjugate is **$2 + \sqrt{3}$**. | N/A |
| **2. Multiply** | Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate. | $$\frac{10}{2 - \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2 + \sqrt{3}}$$ |
| **3. Simplify Denominator** | Use the difference of squares formula, $a^2 - b^2$: | $$(2)^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$$ |
| **4. Simplify Numerator** | Distribute the 10 across the conjugate: | $$10(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 20 + 10\sqrt{3}$$ |
| **5. Final Answer** | Combine the simplified parts: | $$\frac{20 + 10\sqrt{3}}{1} = 20 + 10\sqrt{3}$$ |

The initial expression is:
$$\frac{4}{-1 - \sqrt{3x^4}}$$

#### 1. Initial Simplification of the Radical

First, simplify the radical term $\sqrt{3x^4}$:
$$\sqrt{3x^4} = \sqrt{x^4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = x^{4/2}\sqrt{3} = x^2\sqrt{3}$$

The rational expression becomes:
$$\frac{4}{-1 - x^2\sqrt{3}}$$

### 📝 Rationalizing the Denominator: Two Radical Terms ($\frac{6a}{\sqrt{3a^2} - \sqrt{2a^2}}$)

The expression to rationalize is:
$$\frac{6a}{\sqrt{3a^2} - \sqrt{2a^2}}$$

#### 1. Initial Simplification of Radicals

First, simplify both radical terms in the denominator using the property $\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}$ and assuming $a$ is positive so $\sqrt{a^2} = a$.

* **First term:** $\sqrt{3a^2} = \sqrt{a^2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = a\sqrt{3}$
* **Second term:** $\sqrt{2a^2} = \sqrt{a^2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = a\sqrt{2}$

The simplified expression is:
$$\frac{6a}{a\sqrt{3} - a\sqrt{2}}$$

#### 2. Factor the Denominator and Simplify the Expression

The denominator has a common factor of $a$. Factor it out:
$$\frac{6a}{a(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})}$$

Cancel the common factor $a$ from the numerator and the denominator:
$$\frac{6}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}}$$

#### 3. Identify the Conjugate

The simplified denominator is $\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}$. The conjugate is obtained by changing the sign between the two terms:
$$\text{Conjugate} = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}$$

#### 4. Multiply by the Conjugate

Multiply the fraction by $\frac{\text{Conjugate}}{\text{Conjugate}}$:
$$\frac{6}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}$$

#### 5. Simplify the Denominator (Difference of Squares)

Use the formula $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$:
$$\text{Denominator} = (\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2$$
$$\text{Denominator} = 3 - 2 = 1$$

#### 6. Simplify the Numerator

Distribute the 6:
$$\text{Numerator} = 6(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})$$
$$\text{Numerator} = 6\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{2}$$

#### 7. Final Rationalized Expression

Combine the simplified numerator over the denominator (which is 1):

$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{6\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{2}}{1}$$
$$\text{Final Answer} = 6\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{2}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When working with radicals, the absolute first step should be to **simplify all radicals** before applying any other operation, such as finding the conjugate. In this problem, initial simplification allowed for the **cancellation of 'a'**, which significantly simplified the conjugation process.
### 📝 Rationalizing the Denominator: Complex Expression ($\frac{2 + 8\sqrt{x^4}}{3\sqrt{3x^3} - 6\sqrt{5x}}$)

The expression to rationalize is:
$$\frac{2 + 8\sqrt{x^4}}{3\sqrt{3x^3} - 6\sqrt{5x}}$$

#### 1. Initial Simplification of Numerator and Denominator Radicals

Simplify all radical terms, assuming $x > 0$:

* **Numerator radical:** $\sqrt{x^4} = x^{4/2} = x^2$
    * *Numerator becomes:* $2 + 8x^2$

* **Denominator first term:** $3\sqrt{3x^3} = 3\sqrt{3 \cdot x^2 \cdot x} = 3 \cdot x \sqrt{3x}$
    * *Denominator first term becomes:* $3x\sqrt{3x}$

* **Denominator second term:** $6\sqrt{5x}$ (Cannot be simplified further)
    * *Denominator second term remains:* $6\sqrt{5x}$

The simplified expression is:
$$\frac{2 + 8x^2}{3x\sqrt{3x} - 6\sqrt{5x}}$$

#### 2. Identify the Conjugate

The denominator is $3x\sqrt{3x} - 6\sqrt{5x}$. The conjugate is:
$$\text{Conjugate} = 3x\sqrt{3x} + 6\sqrt{5x}$$

#### 3. Multiply by the Conjugate

Multiply the simplified fraction by $\frac{\text{Conjugate}}{\text{Conjugate}}$:
$$\frac{2 + 8x^2}{3x\sqrt{3x} - 6\sqrt{5x}} \times \frac{3x\sqrt{3x} + 6\sqrt{5x}}{3x\sqrt{3x} + 6\sqrt{5x}}$$

#### 4. Simplify the Denominator (Difference of Squares)

Use the formula $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$, where $a = 3x\sqrt{3x}$ and $b = 6\sqrt{5x}$:

$$\text{Denominator} = (3x\sqrt{3x})^2 - (6\sqrt{5x})^2$$
$$\text{Denominator} = (3x)^2 (\sqrt{3x})^2 - (6^2)(\sqrt{5x})^2$$
$$\text{Denominator} = (9x^2)(3x) - (36)(5x)$$
$$\text{Denominator} = 27x^3 - 180x$$

#### 5. Simplify the Numerator (Distribute)

Multiply the two binomials:
$$\text{Numerator} = (2 + 8x^2)(3x\sqrt{3x} + 6\sqrt{5x})$$
$$\text{Numerator} = 2(3x\sqrt{3x}) + 2(6\sqrt{5x}) + 8x^2(3x\sqrt{3x}) + 8x^2(6\sqrt{5x})$$
$$\text{Numerator} = 6x\sqrt{3x} + 12\sqrt{5x} + 24x^3\sqrt{3x} + 48x^2\sqrt{5x}$$

#### 6. Factor the Denominator

Factor out the Greatest Common Factor ($9x$) from the denominator:
$$\text{Denominator} = 9x(3x^2 - 20)$$

#### 7. Final Rationalized Expression

Combine the simplified numerator and factored denominator:

$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{6x\sqrt{3x} + 12\sqrt{5x} + 24x^3\sqrt{3x} + 48x^2\sqrt{5x}}{9x(3x^2 - 20)}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

For expressions with variables under the radical:
1.  **Always** factor out any perfect square terms (like $x^2$) from under the radical first.
2.  After using the difference of squares, the denominator will contain **no radicals** but may still have a common variable factor ($9x$ in this case), which should be factored out for the simplest final presentation.
### 📝 Rationalizing a Denominator with Three Terms ($\frac{4}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{6}}$)

The expression to rationalize is:
$$\frac{4}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} - \sqrt{6}}$$

Since the denominator has three terms, we must **group two terms** together and treat the expression as a binomial $(A - B)$ to apply the conjugate method.

#### 1. Grouping and Identifying the First Conjugate

Group the first two terms: $A = (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})$ and $B = \sqrt{6}$.
The denominator is $(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) - \sqrt{6}$.
The **first conjugate** is $(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) + \sqrt{6}$.

#### 2. Apply the First Conjugate

Multiply the fraction by $\frac{(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) + \sqrt{6}}{(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}) + \sqrt{6}}$.

**Numerator (N1):**
$$N_1 = 4(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{6})$$
$$N_1 = 4\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{7} + 4\sqrt{6}$$

**Denominator (D1):**
Using the difference of squares $(A-B)(A+B) = A^2 - B^2$:
$$D_1 = (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7})^2 - (\sqrt{6})^2$$
$$D_1 = ((\sqrt{3})^2 + 2\sqrt{3}\sqrt{7} + (\sqrt{7})^2) - 6$$
$$D_1 = (3 + 2\sqrt{21} + 7) - 6$$
$$D_1 = 10 + 2\sqrt{21} - 6$$
$$D_1 = 4 + 2\sqrt{21}$$

The expression is now:
$$\frac{4\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{7} + 4\sqrt{6}}{4 + 2\sqrt{21}}$$

#### 3. Identify the Second Conjugate

The new denominator is $4 + 2\sqrt{21}$. The **second conjugate** is $4 - 2\sqrt{21}$.

#### 4. Apply the Second Conjugate

Multiply the new expression by $\frac{4 - 2\sqrt{21}}{4 - 2\sqrt{21}}$.

**Denominator (D2):**
Using the difference of squares:
$$D_2 = (4)^2 - (2\sqrt{21})^2$$
$$D_2 = 16 - (4 \cdot 21)$$
$$D_2 = 16 - 84$$
$$D_2 = -68$$

**Numerator (N2):**
$N_2 = (4\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{7} + 4\sqrt{6})(4 - 2\sqrt{21})$
Factor out 4 from the first part and 2 from the second part:
$N_2 = 4(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{6}) \cdot 2(2 - \sqrt{21})$
$N_2 = 8(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{6})(2 - \sqrt{21})$

Distribute the terms inside the parentheses (this is complex, but necessary):
$N_2 = 8 [ 2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3}\sqrt{21} + 2\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{7}\sqrt{21} + 2\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{6}\sqrt{21} ]$

Simplify the product terms (since $21 = 3 \cdot 7$):
* $\sqrt{3}\sqrt{21} = \sqrt{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 7} = 3\sqrt{7}$
* $\sqrt{7}\sqrt{21} = \sqrt{7 \cdot 7 \cdot 3} = 7\sqrt{3}$
* $\sqrt{6}\sqrt{21} = \sqrt{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7} = 3\sqrt{14}$

Substitute these back into $N_2$:
$N_2 = 8 [ 2\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{7} - 7\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]$

Combine like terms ($\sqrt{3}$ terms and $\sqrt{7}$ terms):
$N_2 = 8 [ (2\sqrt{3} - 7\sqrt{3}) + (-3\sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{7}) + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]$
$N_2 = 8 [ -5\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]$

#### 5. Write the Final Expression

$$\text{Final Expression} = \frac{8 [ -5\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]}{-68}$$

Simplify the fraction by dividing 8 and -68 by their GCF, which is 4:
$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{2 [ -5\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]}{-17}$$

To eliminate the negative sign in the denominator, multiply the entire numerator by $-1$ and the denominator by $-1$:
$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{-2 [ -5\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{7} + 2\sqrt{6} - 3\sqrt{14} ]}{17}$$

$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{10\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{7} - 4\sqrt{6} + 6\sqrt{14}}{17}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

To rationalize a denominator with **three radical terms**, the process involves:
1.  **Grouping** two terms, treating the expression as a binomial $(A \pm B)$.
2.  Multiplying by the **first conjugate** to reduce the denominator to an expression with only **one radical term**.
3.  Multiplying by the **second conjugate** to complete the rationalization.
## Algebra II - Lesson 60 - Solving Equations with Radicals - 19November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=25h46m05s
- IF both sides of an equation are raised to the same power, all solutions of the original equation are solutions to the new equation - It doesn't go in reverse though, some information is lost (like if you square x=3 $x^2 = 9$ the solution set can be { -3,  3} ) each solution to the new equation isn't neccesarily a solution to the old equation, this is known as an **Extraneous Solution** - So when you get your solution, you need to plug them back in to the old equation and see if they work or don't work
- **Steps for Solving Equations with Radicals** : 
  1) Isolate one of the radicals
  2) Raise both sides of the equation to a power equal to the index of the radical
  3) Repeat the previous two steps if neccesary
  4) Solve the equation, ahd check all solutions in the original equation
- When you want to get rid of a radical sign in an equation, just square both sides
- When you square one side of an equation with something like $b - 8$ you need to expand it fully (not just the 'b' or the '8'), so it becomes $(b-8)^2$ which means you need to expand it using *FOIL* so it's $(b - 8)(b -8)$ = $b^2 - 16b + 64$ 
### 📝 Radical Equation Solution ($\sqrt{p + 4} = 5$)

The equation from the image is:
$$\sqrt{p + 4} = 5$$

#### 1. Isolate the Radical Term

In this case, the entire radical term $\sqrt{p + 4}$ is already isolated on the left side of the equation.

#### 2. Square Both Sides

To eliminate the square root, square both sides of the equation:

$$(\sqrt{p + 4})^2 = (5)^2$$
$$p + 4 = 25$$

#### 3. Solve for p

Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for $p$:

$$p = 25 - 4$$
$$p = 21$$

#### 4. Check for Extraneous Solutions

Substitute the proposed solution $p = 21$ back into the original equation $\sqrt{p + 4} = 5$:

$$\sqrt{(21) + 4} \stackrel{?}{=} 5$$
$$\sqrt{25} \stackrel{?}{=} 5$$
$$5 = 5 \quad \text{(True)}$$

Since the left side equals the right side, the solution $p = 21$ is **valid**.

$$\text{Solution: } p = 21$$

***

#### 🧠 Note on the Square Root

Remember that $\sqrt{x}$ by convention refers to the **principal (positive) square root** of $x$. This is why the positive value $5$ is the only value we check against, and why $p=21$ is a valid solution.

### 📝 Solving an Equation with Two Radical Terms ($\sqrt{3x - 16} = \sqrt{19 - 2x}$)

The equation to solve is:
$$\sqrt{3x - 16} = \sqrt{19 - 2x}$$

#### 1. Eliminate the Radicals

Since both radical terms are already isolated on opposite sides of the equation, we can eliminate them by **squaring both sides**:

$$(\sqrt{3x - 16})^2 = (\sqrt{19 - 2x})^2$$
$$3x - 16 = 19 - 2x$$

#### 2. Solve the Linear Equation

Now, collect the $x$ terms on one side and the constant terms on the other.

Add $2x$ to both sides:
$$3x + 2x - 16 = 19$$
$$5x - 16 = 19$$

Add $16$ to both sides:
$$5x = 19 + 16$$
$$5x = 35$$

Divide by 5:
$$x = \frac{35}{5}$$
$$x = 7$$

#### 3. Check for Extraneous Solutions

Substitute the proposed solution $x = 7$ back into the original equation $\sqrt{3x - 16} = \sqrt{19 - 2x}$ to check for validity.

**Left Side (LS):**
$$LS = \sqrt{3(7) - 16}$$
$$LS = \sqrt{21 - 16}$$
$$LS = \sqrt{5}$$

**Right Side (RS):**
$$RS = \sqrt{19 - 2(7)}$$
$$RS = \sqrt{19 - 14}$$
$$RS = \sqrt{5}$$

Since $LS = RS$, the solution $x = 7$ is **valid**.

$$\text{Solution: } x = 7$$

***

#### 🧠 Note on Domain

For a solution to be physically possible, the expression under **every** square root must be greater than or equal to zero.
1. $3x - 16 \ge 0 \implies x \ge 16/3 \approx 5.33$
2. $19 - 2x \ge 0 \implies 19 \ge 2x \implies x \le 9.5$

Our solution, $x=7$, falls within the valid domain $5.33 \le x \le 9.5$, confirming its reasonableness before the final check.
### 📝 Solving a Radical Equation Resulting in a Quadratic ($8 + \sqrt{34 - 3b} = b$)

The equation to solve is:
$$8 + \sqrt{34 - 3b} = b$$

#### 1. Isolate the Radical Term

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the radical:
$$\sqrt{34 - 3b} = b - 8$$

#### 2. Square Both Sides

Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the radical. **Be careful to correctly expand the binomial on the right side:** $(b - 8)^2$:

$$(\sqrt{34 - 3b})^2 = (b - 8)^2$$
$$34 - 3b = b^2 - 16b + 64$$

#### 3. Rearrange into a Quadratic Equation

Move all terms to one side to set the quadratic equal to zero:

$$0 = b^2 - 16b + 3b + 64 - 34$$
$$0 = b^2 - 13b + 30$$

#### 4. Solve the Quadratic Equation

Factor the quadratic expression $b^2 - 13b + 30 = 0$. We look for two numbers that multiply to 30 and add up to -13. These numbers are -10 and -3.

$$(b - 10)(b - 3) = 0$$

This gives two possible solutions:
$$b = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad b = 3$$

#### 5. Check for Extraneous Solutions

We must check both proposed solutions in the **original equation**: $8 + \sqrt{34 - 3b} = b$.

##### Check 1: $b = 10$

$$8 + \sqrt{34 - 3(10)} \stackrel{?}{=} 10$$
$$8 + \sqrt{34 - 30} \stackrel{?}{=} 10$$
$$8 + \sqrt{4} \stackrel{?}{=} 10$$
$$8 + 2 \stackrel{?}{=} 10$$
$$10 = 10 \quad \text{(True)}$$
**$b = 10$ is a valid solution.**

##### Check 2: $b = 3$

$$8 + \sqrt{34 - 3(3)} \stackrel{?}{=} 3$$
$$8 + \sqrt{34 - 9} \stackrel{?}{=} 3$$
$$8 + \sqrt{25} \stackrel{?}{=} 3$$
$$8 + 5 \stackrel{?}{=} 3$$
$$13 = 3 \quad \text{(False)}$$
**$b = 3$ is an extraneous solution.**

$$\text{Final Solution: } b = 10$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When solving a radical equation that leads to a quadratic, **both** solutions from the quadratic equation **must** be checked in the original radical equation. In this case, $b=3$ was introduced when we squared both sides, making it **extraneous**. Also, note the important constraint: the right side, $b-8$, must be $\ge 0$ since it equals a positive square root. This means $b \ge 8$, which immediately rules out $b=3$.

### 📝 Solving an Equation with Two Radicals (Double Squaring) ($\sqrt{9k - 2} = 4 + \sqrt{4 - k}$)

The equation to solve is:
$$\sqrt{9k - 2} = 4 + \sqrt{4 - k}$$

#### 1. Square Both Sides (First Time)

The radicals are already isolated on opposite sides. Square both sides:

$$(\sqrt{9k - 2})^2 = (4 + \sqrt{4 - k})^2$$
$$9k - 2 = (4)^2 + 2(4)(\sqrt{4 - k}) + (\sqrt{4 - k})^2$$
$$9k - 2 = 16 + 8\sqrt{4 - k} + (4 - k)$$
$$9k - 2 = 20 - k + 8\sqrt{4 - k}$$

#### 2. Isolate the Remaining Radical Term

Move all non-radical terms to the left side to isolate $8\sqrt{4 - k}$:

$$9k + k - 2 - 20 = 8\sqrt{4 - k}$$
$$10k - 22 = 8\sqrt{4 - k}$$

Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify the numbers:
$$5k - 11 = 4\sqrt{4 - k}$$

#### 3. Square Both Sides (Second Time)

Square both sides again to eliminate the final radical. **Be careful to expand the binomial on the left side** $(5k - 11)^2$:

$$(5k - 11)^2 = (4\sqrt{4 - k})^2$$
$$(5k)^2 - 2(5k)(11) + 11^2 = 4^2 (\sqrt{4 - k})^2$$
$$25k^2 - 110k + 121 = 16(4 - k)$$
$$25k^2 - 110k + 121 = 64 - 16k$$

#### 4. Rearrange into a Quadratic Equation

Move all terms to the left side to set the quadratic equal to zero:

$$25k^2 - 110k + 16k + 121 - 64 = 0$$
$$25k^2 - 94k + 57 = 0$$

#### 5. Solve the Quadratic Equation

Use factoring or the quadratic formula. Since $25k^2 - 94k + 57 = 0$ is factorable, we use factoring:
$$(25k - 19)(k - 3) = 0$$

This gives two possible solutions:
$$25k - 19 = 0 \implies k = \frac{19}{25}$$
$$k - 3 = 0 \implies k = 3$$

#### 6. Check for Extraneous Solutions

We must check both proposed solutions in the **original equation**: $\sqrt{9k - 2} = 4 + \sqrt{4 - k}$.

##### Check 1: $k = 3$

$$\sqrt{9(3) - 2} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + \sqrt{4 - 3}$$
$$\sqrt{27 - 2} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + \sqrt{1}$$
$$\sqrt{25} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + 1$$
$$5 = 5 \quad \text{(True)}$$
**$k = 3$ is a valid solution.**

##### Check 2: $k = \frac{19}{25}$

Substitute $k = 0.76$:
$$\sqrt{9(0.76) - 2} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + \sqrt{4 - 0.76}$$
$$\sqrt{6.84 - 2} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + \sqrt{3.24}$$
$$\sqrt{4.84} \stackrel{?}{=} 4 + 1.8$$
$$2.2 \stackrel{?}{=} 5.8 \quad \text{(False)}$$
**$k = \frac{19}{25}$ is an extraneous solution.**

$$\text{Final Solution: } k = 3$$

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

A radical equation requiring **two steps of squaring** will always lead to a quadratic equation. This dramatically increases the chance of generating **extraneous solutions**. The process is:
1. Isolate one radical.
2. Square both sides.
3. Isolate the *remaining* radical (or simplify to isolate the power, as in the quadratic form).
4. Square both sides again.
5. Solve the resulting non-radical equation.
6. **Check all resulting solutions** in the original equation.
### 📝 Solving an Equation with Cubic Roots ($\sqrt[3]{31 - x} = \sqrt[3]{x^2 + 11}$)

The equation to solve is:
$$\sqrt[3]{31 - x} = \sqrt[3]{x^2 + 11}$$

#### 1. Eliminate the Cubic Roots

Since the cubic root terms are already isolated on opposite sides of the equation, we can eliminate them by **cubing both sides**:

$$\left(\sqrt[3]{31 - x}\right)^3 = \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 + 11}\right)^3$$
$$31 - x = x^2 + 11$$

#### 2. Rearrange into a Quadratic Equation

Move all terms to one side to set the quadratic equal to zero:

$$0 = x^2 + x + 11 - 31$$
$$0 = x^2 + x - 20$$

#### 3. Solve the Quadratic Equation

Factor the quadratic expression $x^2 + x - 20 = 0$. We look for two numbers that multiply to $-20$ and add up to $1$. These numbers are $5$ and $-4$.

$$(x + 5)(x - 4) = 0$$

This gives two possible solutions:
$$x + 5 = 0 \implies x = -5$$
$$x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4$$

#### 4. Check the Solutions (Optional but Recommended)

While cubing an equation does not introduce extraneous solutions, it is good practice to check the solutions, especially for potential arithmetic errors.

##### Check 1: $x = -5$

$$\sqrt[3]{31 - (-5)} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt[3]{(-5)^2 + 11}$$
$$\sqrt[3]{36} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt[3]{25 + 11}$$
$$\sqrt[3]{36} = \sqrt[3]{36} \quad \text{(True)}$$
**$x = -5$ is a valid solution.**

##### Check 2: $x = 4$

$$\sqrt[3]{31 - 4} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt[3]{(4)^2 + 11}$$
$$\sqrt[3]{27} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt[3]{16 + 11}$$
$$\sqrt[3]{27} = \sqrt[3]{27}$$
$$3 = 3 \quad \text{(True)}$$
**$x = 4$ is a valid solution.**

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 4 \text{ and } x = -5$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

For equations involving **odd roots** (like cubic roots, $\sqrt[3]{}$), cubing or raising to the $n^{th}$ power does **not** introduce extraneous solutions because odd roots preserve the sign of the value under the radical. Therefore, all algebraically derived solutions will be valid.

- When you square a number the result is non negative.
- $x^2 + 1 = 0$ : $x^2 = -1$ : Using real numbers, you can not get a solution, because what number squared is equal to '-1' 
- $i^2 = -1$ : $\sqrt{i^2} = \sqrt{-1}$ : $i = \sqrt{-1}$ :  **Imaginary Unit** : When you want to take the square root of a negative number
- Don't get confused with the difference between $- \sqrt{9}$ = -3 and $\sqrt{-9}$  = No Real Solution : 
- $i = \sqrt{-1}$ : $\sqrt{-9} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{9}$ : $\sqrt{-9} = i \cdot \sqrt{9}$ : 3i 
- When working with multiplication and division, we must change the form first. 
- A **complex number** is formed using the *imaginary unit* along with our *real numbers* : Let 'a' and 'b' be any two real numbers : $a + bi$ - In order to add or subtract complex numbers, we use our commutative, associative, and distributive properties. - To add complex numbers, you combine the **real parts** and combine the **imaginary parts** separately. - basically, you are combing like terms
- $a + bi$ : **Standard Form of a Complex Number** 
- We Multiply two complex numbers using the same methods we used for polynomials 
- When dividing complex numbers, the conjugates $(a + bi)(a -bi) = a^2 + b^2$ notice that a negative times a positive gives a positive, since $i^2$ is '-1'
- $(a + bi)(a -bi) = a^2 -abi + abi - b^2 i^2$ = $a^2 + b^2$
- The quotient of 2 complex numbers is a comlex number : $\frac{7}{3i}$ = $\frac{7i}{-3}$ (multiplied by 'i' to clear the radical on denominator)
- since 'i' is $\sqrt{-1}$ you can not leave it in the denominator because it's a radical
### 📝 Definition of the Imaginary Unit ($i$)

The imaginary unit, denoted as **$i$**, is a mathematical concept defined to be the solution to the equation $x^2 = -1$.

$$-i^2 = -1$$
$$\sqrt{i^2} = \sqrt{-1}$$
$$i = \sqrt{-1}$$

**Imaginary Unit**: When you want to take the square root of a negative number, the result is expressed as a multiple of the imaginary unit $i$, which is **defined as the principal square root of negative one**. This unit allows us to **extend the real number system to the complex number system** to solve all polynomial equations, such as $x^2 + 1 = 0$, which have no solution in the real number system.
### 📝 How the Imaginary Unit ($i$) Works

The imaginary unit, **$i$**, is the cornerstone of complex numbers. It works by providing a way to deal with the square roots of negative numbers, which are impossible in the real number system.

#### 1. Fundamental Definition
The imaginary unit is strictly **defined** as the principal square root of negative one:
$$i = \sqrt{-1}$$
Consequently, when you square $i$, you get the value under the original radical:
$$i^2 = -1$$

#### 2. Using $i$ to Simplify Radicals
To take the square root of any negative number, we use the property $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$ to factor out the $\sqrt{-1}$ term.

**Example: Simplifying $\sqrt{-9}$**

* **Step 1: Factor out $\sqrt{-1}$.** Separate the negative sign from the positive part of the number under the radical:
    $$\sqrt{-9} = \sqrt{(-1) \cdot 9}$$
    $$\sqrt{-9} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{9}$$

* **Step 2: Substitute $i$ and simplify the real part.** Replace $\sqrt{-1}$ with $i$ and evaluate the square root of the positive number:
    $$\sqrt{-9} = i \cdot 3$$
    $$\sqrt{-9} = 3i$$

**Key Rule:** For any positive real number $a$:
$$\sqrt{-a} = i\sqrt{a}$$

This process allows us to express the square root of any negative number as a **real number multiple of the imaginary unit $i$**.
### 🧠 The Core Definitions of $i$ and $i^2$

* **The Imaginary Unit ($i$) is equal to the square root of negative 1.**
    * $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$
    * $i$ is an imaginary number.

* **$i^2$ is equal to negative 1.**
    * $$i^2 = -1$$
    * $i^2$ is a **real number** (specifically, $-1$).

---

#### Why they are different:

The relationship is that **squaring $i$ gives you $-1$**:

$$i^2 = (\sqrt{-1})^2 = -1$$

If $i$ itself were equal to $-1$, then $i$ would be a real number, which contradicts its definition as an imaginary unit.

* $i = \text{Imaginary}$
* $i^2 = \text{Real}$
### 🧠 Complex Conjugates: The Key to Division

The **complex conjugate** is a fundamental tool used in complex arithmetic, primarily to **rationalize the denominator** when performing division. 

[Image of complex conjugate on a complex plane]


#### 1. Definition of the Complex Conjugate

For any complex number $z = a + bi$, the complex conjugate, denoted as $\bar{z}$, is found by simply **changing the sign of the imaginary part**.

| Complex Number ($z$) | Complex Conjugate ($\bar{z}$) |
| :---: | :---: |
| $2 + 5i$ | $2 - 5i$ |
| $-7 - i$ | $-7 + i$ |
| $4i$ (or $0 + 4i$) | $-4i$ (or $0 - 4i$) |

#### 2. The Conjugate Property

When you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, the imaginary terms always **cancel out**, resulting in a **positive real number**.

Let $z = a + bi$ and $\bar{z} = a - bi$. We use the **Difference of Squares** formula: $(A+B)(A-B) = A^2 - B^2$.

$$z \cdot \bar{z} = (a + bi)(a - bi)$$
$$z \cdot \bar{z} = a^2 - (bi)^2$$
$$z \cdot \bar{z} = a^2 - b^2i^2$$

Since $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$:
$$z \cdot \bar{z} = a^2 - b^2(-1)$$
$$\mathbf{z \cdot \bar{z} = a^2 + b^2}$$

#### 3. Fully Worked Example

Multiply the complex number $3 + 4i$ by its conjugate, $3 - 4i$:

$$\text{Product} = (3 + 4i)(3 - 4i)$$
$$\text{Product} = (3)^2 + (4)^2$$
$$\text{Product} = 9 + 16$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Product} = 25}$$

Notice the final result is a **positive real number** ($\mathbf{25}$), and it has **no imaginary component**. This is why the conjugate is used to remove the imaginary part from a denominator.

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Multiplying by the conjugate is the key to division:
$$\frac{c+di}{a+bi} = \frac{c+di}{a+bi} \cdot \frac{a-bi}{a-bi} = \frac{\text{New Numerator}}{\mathbf{a^2 + b^2}}$$
### 🧠 Powers of the Imaginary Unit ($i$)

The powers of the imaginary unit $i$ follow a cyclical pattern that repeats every four exponents. This cycle allows you to simplify $i^n$ for any integer exponent $n$.

#### 1. The Four-Term Cycle (The Foundation)

The sequence of the first four powers of $i$ is the basis for all simplifications:

| Power | Calculation | Result |
| :---: | :---: | :----: |
| $i^1$ | $i$ | $i$ |
| $i^2$ | $i \cdot i$ | $-1$ |
| $i^3$ | $i^2 \cdot i$ | $-i$ |
| $i^4$ | $i^2 \cdot i^2$ | $1$ |

**Key Principle**: Since $i^4 = 1$, any factor of $i^4$ can be ignored, as multiplying by 1 does not change the value.

---

#### 2. The Simplification Method

To find the value of $i^n$ for any integer $n$, you only need to determine where the exponent falls within the repeating cycle.

**Step 1: Divide the Exponent by 4**
Divide the exponent $n$ by 4 to find the whole number of cycles and the remainder.

$$n \div 4 = Q \text{ remainder } r$$
*(Where $Q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder: 0, 1, 2, or 3)*

**Step 2: Use the Remainder ($r$)**
The value of $i^n$ is equal to the value of $i^r$.

$$i^n = i^{4Q + r} = (i^4)^Q \cdot i^r = (1)^Q \cdot i^r = \mathbf{i^r}$$

**Step 3: Match the Remainder to the Cycle Result**
Use the remainder $r$ to find the final simplified value:

* If the remainder is $1$, the result is $\mathbf{i}$.
* If the remainder is $2$, the result is $\mathbf{-1}$.
* If the remainder is $3$, the result is $\mathbf{-i}$.
* If the remainder is $0$, the result is $\mathbf{1}$ (since $i^4 = 1$).

#### 3. Fully Worked Example: $i^{35}$

Find the simplified value of $i^{35}$:

1.  **Divide by 4:** $35 \div 4 = 8 \text{ with a remainder of } 3$.
2.  **Use Remainder:** $i^{35} = i^3$.
3.  **Result:** Since $i^3 = -i$, the final simplified value is $\mathbf{-i}$.

$$\text{Solution: } i^{35} = -i$$
### 📝 Simplifying Negative Radicals Using the Imaginary Unit ($i$)

The goal is to simplify $\sqrt{-a}$ into the form $i\sqrt{a}$ and then simplify the radical $\sqrt{a}$ if possible.

#### 1. Solving $\sqrt{-10}$

This radical cannot be simplified further as the real number 10 has no perfect square factors (besides 1).

* **Step 1: Factor out $\sqrt{-1}$**
    $$\sqrt{-10} = \sqrt{(-1) \cdot 10}$$
    $$\sqrt{-10} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{10}$$

* **Step 2: Substitute $i$**
    $$\sqrt{-10} = i\sqrt{10}$$

#### 2. Solving $\sqrt{-20}$

This radical can be simplified because the real number 20 contains the perfect square factor 4 ($20 = 4 \cdot 5$).

* **Step 1: Factor out $\sqrt{-1}$**
    $$\sqrt{-20} = \sqrt{(-1) \cdot 20}$$
    $$\sqrt{-20} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{20}$$

* **Step 2: Substitute $i$ and factor the real part**
    $$\sqrt{-20} = i\sqrt{4 \cdot 5}$$
    $$\sqrt{-20} = i\sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{5}$$

* **Step 3: Simplify the perfect square**
    $$\sqrt{-20} = i \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{5}$$
    $$\sqrt{-20} = 2i\sqrt{5}$$

***

#### ✅ Final Answers

* **$$\sqrt{-10} = i\sqrt{10}$$**
* **$$\sqrt{-20} = 2i\sqrt{5}$$**

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Always simplify the non-negative radical ($\sqrt{a}$) **after** separating the $\sqrt{-1}$ term. The final simplified form should place the real number factor (if any) before $i$, and $i$ before the radical (e.g., $2i\sqrt{5}$ is standard).
### 📝 Multiplying Negative Radicals ($\sqrt{-2} \cdot \sqrt{-18}$)

The problem is to solve:
$$\sqrt{-2} \cdot \sqrt{-18}$$

**Crucial Step**: Before multiplying, you **must** convert the negative radicals into imaginary numbers using the definition $i = \sqrt{-1}$. If you multiply first, you will get the incorrect answer $\sqrt{(-2)(-18)} = \sqrt{36} = 6$.

#### 1. Convert to Imaginary Numbers

Apply the rule $\sqrt{-a} = i\sqrt{a}$ to both factors:

* $$\sqrt{-2} = i\sqrt{2}$$
* $$\sqrt{-18} = i\sqrt{18}$$

The expression becomes:
$$(i\sqrt{2}) \cdot (i\sqrt{18})$$

#### 2. Multiply the Terms

Multiply the imaginary parts ($i \cdot i$) and the radical parts ($\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{18}$):

$$i^2 \cdot (\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{18})$$
$$i^2 \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot 18}$$
$$i^2 \cdot \sqrt{36}$$

#### 3. Simplify $i^2$ and the Radical

Substitute $i^2 = -1$ and simplify $\sqrt{36}$:

$$(-1) \cdot 6$$
$$-6$$

$$\text{Final Answer: } -6$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Always convert all negative radicals to their imaginary form ($i\sqrt{a}$) **before** multiplying or dividing.

$$\sqrt{-a} \cdot \sqrt{-b} \ne \sqrt{ab}$$
$$\sqrt{-a} \cdot \sqrt{-b} = (i\sqrt{a})(i\sqrt{b}) = i^2\sqrt{ab} = -\sqrt{ab}$$
### 📝 Multiplying Multiple Radicals with Imaginary Units ($\sqrt{-8} \cdot \sqrt{-4} \cdot \sqrt{2}$)

The expression to solve is:
$$\sqrt{-8} \cdot \sqrt{-4} \cdot \sqrt{2}$$

#### 1. Convert Negative Radicals to Imaginary Form

Convert $\sqrt{-8}$ and $\sqrt{-4}$ to the form $i\sqrt{a}$:

* **$$\sqrt{-8} = i\sqrt{8}$$**
* **$$\sqrt{-4} = i\sqrt{4}$$**
* **$$\sqrt{2}$$** (remains unchanged)

The expression becomes:
$$(i\sqrt{8}) \cdot (i\sqrt{4}) \cdot (\sqrt{2})$$

#### 2. Simplify the Imaginary Unit and the Radicals

Simplify the terms within the expression:

* **Imaginary terms:** $i \cdot i = i^2$
* **$\sqrt{4}$ simplifies to 2**
* **$\sqrt{8}$ simplifies to $2\sqrt{2}$** ($\sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 2} = 2\sqrt{2}$)

Substitute the simplified values back into the expression:
$$(i \cdot 2\sqrt{2}) \cdot (i \cdot 2) \cdot (\sqrt{2})$$

#### 3. Group and Multiply

Group the real numbers, the imaginary units, and the radicals:

$$\text{Real Numbers: } 2 \cdot 2 = 4$$
$$\text{Imaginary Units: } i \cdot i = i^2$$
$$\text{Radicals: } \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2$$

Multiply the grouped parts:
$$\text{Result} = (4) \cdot (i^2) \cdot (2)$$

#### 4. Final Simplification

Substitute the definition $i^2 = -1$:
$$\text{Result} = 4 \cdot (-1) \cdot 2$$
$$\text{Result} = -8$$

$$\text{Final Answer: } -8$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When solving mixed radical multiplication:
1.  **Convert first:** Change all $\sqrt{-a}$ to $i\sqrt{a}$.
2.  **Simplify individual radicals:** Simplify terms like $\sqrt{8}$ or $\sqrt{4}$.
3.  **Combine like terms:** Group all real coefficients, all $i$ terms, and all radical terms.
4.  **Substitute $i^2 = -1$** to get the final result, which in this case is a real number.
### 📝 Multiplying a Negative Radical by a Positive Radical

The expression to solve is:
$$\sqrt{-5} \cdot \sqrt{8}$$

#### 1. Convert the Negative Radical to Imaginary Form

The crucial first step is to use the definition $i = \sqrt{-1}$ to convert the negative radical:

$$\sqrt{-5} = \sqrt{(-1) \cdot 5}$$
$$\sqrt{-5} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{5}$$
$$\sqrt{-5} = i\sqrt{5}$$

The expression now is:
$$(i\sqrt{5}) \cdot \sqrt{8}$$

#### 2. Simplify the Real Radical Term

Simplify $\sqrt{8}$ by factoring out the perfect square factor 4 ($\sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 2}$):

$$\sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{2}$$
$$\sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$$

#### 3. Multiply the Simplified Terms

Multiply the simplified imaginary term by the simplified real term:
$$(i\sqrt{5}) \cdot (2\sqrt{2})$$

Group the coefficients, the $i$ term, and the radical terms:
$$\text{Coefficients: } 2$$
$$\text{Imaginary: } i$$
$$\text{Radicals: } \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{10}$$

Multiply them together, maintaining the standard order (Coefficient $\rightarrow i \rightarrow$ Radical):
$$2 \cdot i \cdot \sqrt{10}$$
$$2i\sqrt{10}$$

$$\text{Final Answer: } 2i\sqrt{10}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When multiplying radicals where only **one** radical is negative:
1.  Convert the negative radical using $i$.
2.  The product will remain an imaginary number (in the form $ai\sqrt{b}$) because there is no $i^2$ term to convert to $-1$.
3.  Always simplify the radicals ($\sqrt{5}$ and $\sqrt{8}$ in this case) *before* or *during* the multiplication step.
### 📝 Solving Division of Negative Radicals ($\frac{\sqrt{-100}}{\sqrt{-4}}$)

The problem to solve is the division of two negative square roots:
$$\frac{\sqrt{-100}}{\sqrt{-4}}$$

#### 1. Convert to Imaginary Numbers (Critical Step)

The property $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$ is **not valid** when $a$ and $b$ are negative. We must first convert using the definition $\mathbf{i = \sqrt{-1}}$:

* **Numerator:** $\sqrt{-100} = i\sqrt{100}$
* **Denominator:** $\sqrt{-4} = i\sqrt{4}$

The expression becomes:
$$\frac{i\sqrt{100}}{i\sqrt{4}}$$

#### 2. Simplify the Imaginary Unit and Radicals

* The imaginary units $\mathbf{i}$ in the numerator and denominator **cancel out** ($\frac{i}{i} = 1$).
* Simplify the remaining real radicals:

$$\frac{\cancel{i}\sqrt{100}}{\cancel{i}\sqrt{4}} = \frac{10}{2}$$

#### 3. Final Result

$$\text{Final Answer: } 5$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When dividing two negative radicals, the result is always a **positive real number**. The imaginary parts cancel, making the operation equivalent to dividing the positive versions of the original numbers:
$$\frac{\sqrt{-a}}{\sqrt{-b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$$
### 📝 Dividing Radicals with an Imaginary Denominator ($\frac{\sqrt{28}}{\sqrt{-7}}$)

The expression to solve is:
$$\frac{\sqrt{28}}{\sqrt{-7}}$$

#### 1. Convert the Negative Radical to Imaginary Form

First, convert the denominator using the definition $i = \sqrt{-1}$:

$$\sqrt{-7} = i\sqrt{7}$$

The expression becomes:
$$\frac{\sqrt{28}}{i\sqrt{7}}$$

#### 2. Simplify the Numerator

Simplify the radical in the numerator. Since $28 = 4 \cdot 7$:

$$\sqrt{28} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{7} = 2\sqrt{7}$$

The expression now is:
$$\frac{2\sqrt{7}}{i\sqrt{7}}$$

#### 3. Cancel Common Factors

Cancel the common radical factor $\sqrt{7}$ from the numerator and denominator:

$$\frac{2\cancel{\sqrt{7}}}{i\cancel{\sqrt{7}}} = \frac{2}{i}$$

#### 4. Rationalize the Denominator (Eliminate $i$ from the Denominator)

To simplify the expression completely, we must eliminate the imaginary unit $i$ from the denominator. Multiply the numerator and denominator by $i$:

$$\frac{2}{i} \cdot \frac{i}{i}$$

* **Numerator:** $2 \cdot i = 2i$
* **Denominator:** $i \cdot i = i^2$

Substitute the definition $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ in the denominator:

$$\frac{2i}{-1}$$

#### 5. Final Simplification

Divide by $-1$:

$$\frac{2i}{-1} = -2i$$

$$\text{Final Answer: } -2i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When dividing by a radical containing $-1$:
1.  **Always convert** the $\sqrt{-a}$ term to $i\sqrt{a}$ first.
2.  If $i$ remains in the denominator, you must **rationalize** by multiplying the entire fraction by $\mathbf{\frac{i}{i}}$.
3.  This uses the property $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ to convert the imaginary denominator into a real number.
### 📝 Adding Complex Numbers ($(8 + 2i) + (4 + 7i)$)

The expression to solve is the addition of two complex numbers:
$$(8 + 2i) + (4 + 7i)$$

#### 1. Definition of Complex Addition

To add complex numbers, you combine the **real parts** and combine the **imaginary parts** separately.

Let $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$.
$$z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i$$

#### 2. Group the Real and Imaginary Parts

Identify the terms:
* **Real Parts:** $8$ and $4$
* **Imaginary Parts:** $2i$ and $7i$

Group them together:
$$\text{Sum} = (8 + 4) + (2i + 7i)$$

#### 3. Perform the Addition

Sum the grouped terms:
$$\text{Sum} = 12 + 9i$$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

The result is in the standard form $a + bi$.

$$\text{Final Answer: } 12 + 9i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Adding complex numbers is similar to adding polynomials; you **combine like terms**. The real number part and the imaginary number part are treated as separate, non-mixing components of the complex number system. 
### 📝 Subtracting and Adding Complex Numbers ($-2 + (-2 + i) - (6 - 12i)$)

The expression to solve is:
$$-2 + (-2 + i) - (6 - 12i)$$

#### 1. Distribute the Signs

First, remove the parentheses by distributing the implied positive sign and the negative sign:

$$\text{Expression} = -2 - 2 + i - 6 - (-12i)$$
$$\text{Expression} = -2 - 2 + i - 6 + 12i$$

#### 2. Group the Real and Imaginary Parts

Group the real numbers (those without $i$) and the imaginary numbers (those with $i$) separately:

$$\text{Real Parts} = -2 - 2 - 6$$
$$\text{Imaginary Parts} = i + 12i$$

#### 3. Perform the Addition/Subtraction

Sum the grouped terms:

* **Real Sum:** $-2 - 2 - 6 = -10$
* **Imaginary Sum:** $i + 12i = 13i$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

Combine the resulting real and imaginary parts into the standard form $a + bi$:

$$\text{Final Answer: } -10 + 13i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Operations on complex numbers are performed by treating the **real parts** and the **imaginary parts** as separate, non-mixing variables. The critical step is correctly distributing the negative sign when subtracting a complex number:
$$-(c - di) = -c + di$$
### 📝 Adding Three Complex Numbers ($(7 + 4i) + (-8 + 8i) + (2 - 2i)$)

The expression to solve is the addition of three complex numbers:
$$(7 + 4i) + (-8 + 8i) + (2 - 2i)$$

#### 1. Definition of Complex Addition

To add complex numbers, you **combine the real parts** and **combine the imaginary parts** separately.

Let the expression be $z_1 + z_2 + z_3$:
$$z = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3)i$$

#### 2. Group the Real and Imaginary Parts

Identify and group the terms:

* **Real Parts:** $7$, $-8$, and $2$
* **Imaginary Parts:** $4i$, $8i$, and $-2i$

Group them together:
$$\text{Sum} = (7 + (-8) + 2) + (4i + 8i - 2i)$$

#### 3. Perform the Addition/Subtraction

Sum the grouped terms:

* **Real Sum:** $7 - 8 + 2 = 1$
* **Imaginary Sum:** $(4 + 8 - 2)i = (12 - 2)i = 10i$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

Combine the resulting real and imaginary parts into the standard form $a + bi$:

$$\text{Final Answer: } 1 + 10i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Adding and subtracting multiple complex numbers is simplified by using the commutative and associative properties of addition. You can regroup the terms by color-coding or simply listing the real and imaginary components separately before summing them up.
### 📝 Multiplying Complex Numbers (Monomial by Binomial) ($(-2i)(-5 - 2i)$)

The expression to solve is:
$$(-2i)(-5 - 2i)$$

#### 1. Distribute the Monomial

Multiply the term $-2i$ by each term inside the parentheses ($-5$ and $-2i$):

$$\text{Product} = (-2i) \cdot (-5) + (-2i) \cdot (-2i)$$

#### 2. Perform the Multiplication

* **First Term:** $(-2i) \cdot (-5) = 10i$
* **Second Term:** $(-2i) \cdot (-2i) = 4i^2$

The expression becomes:
$$\text{Product} = 10i + 4i^2$$

#### 3. Substitute $i^2 = -1$

Substitute the definition $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ into the second term:

$$\text{Product} = 10i + 4(-1)$$
$$\text{Product} = 10i - 4$$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

Write the result in the standard complex form $\mathbf{a + bi}$ (Real Part + Imaginary Part):

$$\text{Final Answer: } -4 + 10i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When multiplying complex numbers, the most critical step is to substitute $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$. This conversion moves the term from the imaginary component back into the real component, which is why the final answer is a complex number in the form $a+bi$.
### 📝 Multiplying Two Complex Numbers (FOIL Method) ($(-2 + 6i)(6 - 3i)$)

The expression to solve is the multiplication of two complex numbers:
$$(-2 + 6i)(6 - 3i)$$

We will use the **FOIL** method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to distribute all terms:

#### 1. Apply the FOIL Method

$$\text{Product} = \underbrace{(-2)(6)}_{\text{First}} + \underbrace{(-2)(-3i)}_{\text{Outer}} + \underbrace{(6i)(6)}_{\text{Inner}} + \underbrace{(6i)(-3i)}_{\text{Last}}$$

#### 2. Perform the Multiplication

$$\text{Product} = -12 + 6i + 36i - 18i^2$$

#### 3. Substitute $i^2 = -1$

Substitute the definition $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ into the last term:

$$\text{Product} = -12 + 6i + 36i - 18(-1)$$
$$\text{Product} = -12 + 6i + 36i + 18$$

#### 4. Group and Combine Like Terms

Group the **real parts** and the **imaginary parts** separately:

$$\text{Real Parts} = -12 + 18 = 6$$
$$\text{Imaginary Parts} = 6i + 36i = 42i$$

#### 5. Final Complex Number

Combine the resulting parts into the standard form $\mathbf{a + bi}$:

$$\text{Final Answer: } 6 + 42i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Multiplying complex numbers is essentially a **four-step distribution** followed by a **simplification step** where $\mathbf{i^2}$ is always converted to $\mathbf{-1}$. This conversion is crucial, as it transforms the $i^2$ term from an imaginary component back into a real number.
### 📝 Multiplying Three Complex Numbers ($(3 + 5i)(-7 + 5i)(3 + 7i)$)

The expression to solve is:
$$(3 + 5i)(-7 + 5i)(3 + 7i)$$

We will solve this by multiplying the first two binomials, simplifying the result, and then multiplying by the third binomial.

#### 1. Multiply the First Two Binomials ($z_1 \cdot z_2$)

$$z_1 \cdot z_2 = (3 + 5i)(-7 + 5i)$$

Use the **FOIL** method (First, Outer, Inner, Last):
$$\text{Product}_1 = (3)(-7) + (3)(5i) + (5i)(-7) + (5i)(5i)$$
$$\text{Product}_1 = -21 + 15i - 35i + 25i^2$$

Substitute $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ and combine like terms:
$$\text{Product}_1 = -21 - 20i + 25(-1)$$
$$\text{Product}_1 = -21 - 25 - 20i$$
$$\text{Product}_1 = -46 - 20i$$

#### 2. Multiply the Result by the Third Binomial ($\text{Product}_1 \cdot z_3$)

Now, multiply the result from Step 1 by the third binomial $(3 + 7i)$:
$$\text{Final Product} = (-46 - 20i)(3 + 7i)$$

Use the **FOIL** method again:
$$\text{Final Product} = (-46)(3) + (-46)(7i) + (-20i)(3) + (-20i)(7i)$$

#### 3. Perform the Final Multiplication

$$\text{Final Product} = -138 - 322i - 60i - 140i^2$$

Substitute $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ and combine like terms:
$$\text{Final Product} = -138 - 382i - 140(-1)$$
$$\text{Final Product} = -138 + 140 - 382i$$
$$\text{Final Product} = 2 - 382i$$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

The result is in the standard form $a + bi$.

$$\text{Final Answer: } 2 - 382i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When multiplying three or more complex numbers, always multiply them in **pairs**. Remember that after each multiplication step, you must simplify the result by combining like terms and converting any $i^2$ term into a **real number** (by substituting $i^2 = -1$) before proceeding to the next multiplication.
### 📝 Rationalizing an Imaginary Monomial Denominator

The expression to solve is:
$$\frac{4}{6i}$$

#### 1. Initial Simplification

Simplify the real numbers in the fraction first by dividing the numerator (4) and the denominator (6) by their greatest common factor, 2:

$$\frac{4}{6i} = \frac{2}{3i}$$

#### 2. Rationalize the Denominator

To eliminate the imaginary unit $i$ from the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\mathbf{i}$:

$$\frac{2}{3i} \cdot \frac{i}{i}$$

* **Numerator:** $2 \cdot i = 2i$
* **Denominator:** $3i \cdot i = 3i^2$

#### 3. Substitute $i^2 = -1$

Substitute the definition $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ into the denominator:

$$\frac{2i}{3(-1)}$$
$$\frac{2i}{-3}$$

#### 4. Final Complex Number

Move the negative sign to the front or the numerator to get the standard form of the final answer:

$$\text{Final Answer: } -\frac{2i}{3}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

To rationalize a denominator containing only an imaginary unit $bi$ (where $b \ne 0$):
1.  **Multiply by $\mathbf{\frac{i}{i}}$**. This is equivalent to multiplying by $\frac{b i}{b i}$ but is simpler.
2.  The denominator becomes $b i^2$, which simplifies to the **positive real number $\mathbf{-b}$**.
3.  The final answer must be written in the form $a+bi$. Since the real part is zero, the answer is just the imaginary part.
### 📝 Dividing Complex Numbers Using the Conjugate ($\frac{2 + 6i}{4 - 3i}$)

The expression to solve is:
$$\frac{2 + 6i}{4 - 3i}$$

#### 1. Identify the Complex Conjugate

The denominator is $4 - 3i$. The complex conjugate is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:
$$\text{Conjugate} = 4 + 3i$$

#### 2. Multiply by the Conjugate

Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate $\frac{4 + 3i}{4 + 3i}$:

$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{2 + 6i}{4 - 3i} \cdot \frac{4 + 3i}{4 + 3i}$$

#### 3. Simplify the Denominator (Difference of Squares)

The denominator simplifies to $a^2 + b^2$ where $a=4$ and $b=3$:

$$\text{Denominator} = (4)^2 + (3)^2$$
$$\text{Denominator} = 16 + 9$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Denominator} = 25}$$

#### 4. Simplify the Numerator (FOIL Method)

Use the FOIL method to multiply the two binomials in the numerator:

$$\text{Numerator} = (2)(4) + (2)(3i) + (6i)(4) + (6i)(3i)$$
$$\text{Numerator} = 8 + 6i + 24i + 18i^2$$

Substitute $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ and combine like terms:

$$\text{Numerator} = 8 + 30i + 18(-1)$$
$$\text{Numerator} = 8 - 18 + 30i$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Numerator} = -10 + 30i}$$

#### 5. Final Result in Standard Form

Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:

$$\text{Final Result} = \frac{-10 + 30i}{25}$$

Separate the real and imaginary parts to write the answer in the standard form $a + bi$:

$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{-10}{25} + \frac{30}{25}i$$

Simplify the fractions by dividing the coefficients by their greatest common factor (5):

$$\text{Final Answer: } -\frac{2}{5} + \frac{6}{5}i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Dividing complex numbers is a two-step multiplication process:
1.  **Multiply by the conjugate** to eliminate the imaginary part of the denominator.
2.  **Simplify and separate** the resulting fraction into the $a+bi$ form.
### 📝 Dividing Complex Numbers: Full Conjugate Problem ($\frac{-10 + 7i}{1 + 6i}$)

The expression to solve is:
$$\frac{-10 + 7i}{1 + 6i}$$

#### 1. Identify the Complex Conjugate

The denominator is $1 + 6i$. The complex conjugate is:
$$\text{Conjugate} = 1 - 6i$$

#### 2. Multiply by the Conjugate

Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\frac{1 - 6i}{1 - 6i}$:

$$\text{Fraction} = \frac{-10 + 7i}{1 + 6i} \cdot \frac{1 - 6i}{1 - 6i}$$

#### 3. Simplify the Denominator (Difference of Squares)

Use the property $(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$, where $a=1$ and $b=6$:

$$\text{Denominator} = (1)^2 + (6)^2$$
$$\text{Denominator} = 1 + 36$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Denominator} = 37}$$

#### 4. Simplify the Numerator (FOIL Method)

Use the FOIL method to multiply the two binomials in the numerator:
$$(-10 + 7i)(1 - 6i)$$

$$\text{Numerator} = (-10)(1) + (-10)(-6i) + (7i)(1) + (7i)(-6i)$$
$$\text{Numerator} = -10 + 60i + 7i - 42i^2$$

Substitute $\mathbf{i^2 = -1}$ and combine like terms:

$$\text{Numerator} = -10 + 67i - 42(-1)$$
$$\text{Numerator} = -10 + 42 + 67i$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Numerator} = 32 + 67i}$$

#### 5. Final Result in Standard Form

Combine the simplified numerator and denominator and separate into the $a + bi$ form:

$$\text{Final Answer} = \frac{32 + 67i}{37}$$

$$\text{Final Answer: } \frac{32}{37} + \frac{67}{37}i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

For division problems, the final answer must always be presented in the standard complex form $a+bi$. This often requires separating the single fraction into two fractions after rationalization.
## Algebra II - Lesson 62 - The Square Root Property and Completing the Square - 20November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=26h53m30s
- $ax^2 + bx +c = 0$ : **Standard Form of Quadratic Equation** : a quadratic equation has a squared term and no terms of higher degree, 'a' 'b' and 'c' can be any real number except 'a' is not allowed to be '0'
- **Square Root Property** : $x^2 = k$ means that $x = \sqrt{k}$ or $x = -\sqrt{k}$ : $\pm$ it could be positive or negative
- **Completing the Square** is an algebraic technique used to rewrite a quadratic expression of the form $\mathbf{x^2 + bx}$ into a perfect square trinomial, $\mathbf{(x + d)^2}$. This allows the resulting equation to be solved easily using the **Square Root Property**. - 
- **Completing the Square Process** : 
  1) Make sure the squared term has a coefficient of 1 
  2) Move all variable terms to one side and the constant to the other
  3) Multiply the coefficient of the x term by 1/2, then square it
  4) Add the result to both sides of the equation
  5) Factor the left side and solve the equation using the square root property (You will get a *perfect square trinomial* to turn into a *binomial squared*)
### 📝 The Square Root Property

The **Square Root Property** is a method used to solve quadratic equations that can be written in the form $\mathbf{x^2 = k}$ or $\mathbf{(ax + b)^2 = k}$. It provides a direct path to the solution without needing to factor.

#### 1. Definition and Rule
If $x^2 = k$, then the solution for $x$ must be the positive or negative square root of $k$:
$$x = \pm \sqrt{k}$$

---

#### 2. Fully Worked Examples

The nature of the solutions depends on the value of $k$:

##### A. Case 1: $k > 0$ (Two Real Solutions)

**Problem:** Solve $x^2 = 25$

1.  **Apply the Property:** Take the square root of both sides, remembering the $\pm$ sign.
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{25}$$
2.  **Simplify:**
    $$\mathbf{x = \pm 5}$$
    *Solutions are $x=5$ and $x=-5$.*

---

##### B. Case 2: $k < 0$ (Two Complex Solutions)

**Problem:** Solve $x^2 = -9$

1.  **Apply the Property:**
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{-9}$$
2.  **Simplify using $i = \sqrt{-1}$:**
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{-1}$$
    $$x = \pm 3i$$
    *Solutions are $x=3i$ and $x=-3i$.*

---

##### C. Case 3: Binomial Squared

**Problem:** Solve $(x - 4)^2 = 7$

1.  **Apply the Property:** Take the square root of both sides.
    $$x - 4 = \pm \sqrt{7}$$
2.  **Isolate $x$:** Add 4 to both sides.
    $$x = 4 \pm \sqrt{7}$$
    *Solutions are $x = 4 + \sqrt{7}$ and $x = 4 - \sqrt{7}$.*

---

#### 🧠 Key Takeaways

1.  **Never Forget $\pm$:** The single most common error is forgetting the "plus or minus" $(\pm)$. Squaring a positive number yields a positive result, and squaring a negative number also yields a positive result. Therefore, every non-zero result $k$ has two corresponding roots.
2.  **Isolate First:** The property can only be applied after the $x^2$ term (or the squared binomial) is completely **isolated** on one side of the equation.
3.  **Complex Numbers:** If $k$ is negative, the solutions involve the imaginary unit $i$.
### 🧠 Completing the Square

**Completing the Square** is an algebraic technique used to rewrite a quadratic expression of the form $\mathbf{x^2 + bx}$ into a perfect square trinomial, $\mathbf{(x + d)^2}$. This allows the resulting equation to be solved easily using the **Square Root Property**.

#### 1. The Core Idea: Creating a Perfect Square

A **perfect square trinomial** is a trinomial that can be factored as $(x + d)^2$ or $(x - d)^2$.

For an expression in the form $\mathbf{x^2 + bx + c}$:
* The required constant term $\mathbf{c}$ must be equal to $\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$.

| Initial Expression | Value to Add ($\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$) | Perfect Square Trinomial | Factored Form |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $x^2 + 10x$ | $\left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2 = \mathbf{25}$ | $x^2 + 10x + 25$ | $(x + 5)^2$ |
| $x^2 - 6x$ | $\left(\frac{-6}{2}\right)^2 = \mathbf{9}$ | $x^2 - 6x + 9$ | $(x - 3)^2$ |

---

#### 2. Solving an Equation by Completing the Square

Use this four-step process to solve a quadratic equation of the form $\mathbf{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$.

##### Step 1: Ensure $a = 1$

If $a \ne 1$, divide the entire equation by the coefficient $a$.
$$\frac{ax^2}{a} + \frac{bx}{a} + \frac{c}{a} = 0$$

##### Step 2: Isolate the Variable Terms

Move the constant term to the right side of the equation:
$$x^2 + bx = -c$$

##### Step 3: Complete the Square

1.  Calculate the value to complete the square: $\mathbf{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}$.
2.  Add this value to **both sides** of the equation to maintain balance.
$$x^2 + bx + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = -c + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$$

##### Step 4: Solve using the Square Root Property

1.  Factor the left side into a squared binomial: $\left(\mathbf{x + \frac{b}{2}}\right)^2$.
2.  Take the square root of both sides, remembering the $\pm$ sign.
3.  Isolate $x$ to find the final solutions.

---

#### 3. General Solution and Vertex Form

When completing the square on the general equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$:

$$x^2 + bx + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = c + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$$

This results in the **vertex form** of a parabola:
$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - \left[c - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2\right] = 0$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Completing the Square is not only a solving method but a transformation tool. When applied to $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, it rewrites the function into the **vertex form** $f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
### 📝 Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$) ($2x^2 - 3x - 9 = 0$)

The equation to solve is:
$$2x^2 - 3x - 9 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation where $a=2$, $b=-3$, and $c=-9$. We will use factoring (specifically, the AC method or grouping) to find the solutions.

#### 1. Find the AC Product and Factors

1.  Calculate the product $ac$:
    $$ac = (2)(-9) = -18$$
2.  Find two factors of $-18$ that sum up to $b = -3$.
    *Factors of -18:* $(-1, 18), (1, -18), (-2, 9), (2, -9), (-3, 6), (\mathbf{3, -6})$
    *Sum:* $3 + (-6) = -3$. These are the correct factors.

#### 2. Rewrite the Equation (Split the Middle Term)

Replace the middle term ($-3x$) with the two new terms found in Step 1 ($3x$ and $-6x$):
$$2x^2 + 3x - 6x - 9 = 0$$

#### 3. Group and Factor by Grouping

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:
$$(2x^2 + 3x) + (-6x - 9) = 0$$

Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:
* **First group GCF is $x$**: $x(2x + 3)$
* **Second group GCF is $-3$**: $-3(2x + 3)$

The equation becomes:
$$x(2x + 3) - 3(2x + 3) = 0$$

#### 4. Factor out the Common Binomial

Factor out the common binomial term $(2x + 3)$:
$$(2x + 3)(x - 3) = 0$$

#### 5. Solve for $x$ (Zero Product Property)

Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$:

* **Factor 1:** $2x + 3 = 0$
    $$2x = -3$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -\frac{3}{2}}$$

* **Factor 2:** $x - 3 = 0$
    $$\mathbf{x = 3}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 3 \text{ and } x = -\frac{3}{2}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Factoring is often the fastest method for solving a quadratic equation if the equation is factorable. When $a \ne 1$, the **AC method** (or grouping) is the most reliable systematic approach. Always check that the two binomial factors resulting from the grouping step are identical.
### 📝 Solving $ax^2 + c = k$ Using the Square Root Property (Complex Solutions)

The equation to solve is:
$$2x^2 + 3 = -19$$

#### 1. Isolate the Squared Term ($x^2$)

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
$$2x^2 = -19 - 3$$
$$2x^2 = -22$$

Divide both sides by 2:
$$x^2 = \frac{-22}{2}$$
$$x^2 = -11$$

#### 2. Apply the Square Root Property

Take the square root of both sides, remembering to include the $\pm$ sign. Since the number under the radical is negative, the solutions will be complex.

$$x = \pm \sqrt{-11}$$

#### 3. Simplify using the Imaginary Unit ($i$)

Factor out $\sqrt{-1}$ and substitute the definition $\mathbf{i = \sqrt{-1}}$:

$$x = \pm \sqrt{11} \cdot \sqrt{-1}$$
$$x = \pm i\sqrt{11}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = i\sqrt{11} \text{ and } x = -i\sqrt{11}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When solving $x^2 = k$:
1.  Always **isolate $x^2$** first.
2.  If the resulting constant $k$ is **negative** (as $k=-11$ here), the solutions will be a pair of **complex conjugates** involving the imaginary unit $i$.
3.  The radical $\sqrt{11}$ cannot be simplified further, so it remains in the final answer.
### 📝 Solving $(x + a)^2 + c = k$ Using the Square Root Property ($(x + 12)^2 - 15 = 181$)

The equation to solve is:
$$(x + 12)^2 - 15 = 181$$

This problem is solved by isolating the squared term and then applying the Square Root Property.

#### 1. Isolate the Squared Binomial

Add 15 to both sides of the equation:
$$(x + 12)^2 = 181 + 15$$
$$(x + 12)^2 = 196$$

#### 2. Apply the Square Root Property

Take the square root of both sides, remembering to include the $\pm$ sign:
$$x + 12 = \pm \sqrt{196}$$

Calculate the principal square root of 196:
$$x + 12 = \pm 14$$

#### 3. Isolate $x$

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate $x$:
$$x = -12 \pm 14$$

#### 4. Find the Two Solutions

Separate the $\pm$ into two distinct equations to find the two possible values for $x$:

* **Solution 1 (using +14):**
    $$x_1 = -12 + 14$$
    $$\mathbf{x_1 = 2}$$

* **Solution 2 (using -14):**
    $$x_2 = -12 - 14$$
    $$\mathbf{x_2 = -26}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 2 \text{ and } x = -26$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When solving a squared binomial equal to a constant, the goal is to peel away the surrounding terms one by one:
1.  **Addition/Subtraction:** Eliminate terms outside the parenthesis first (e.g., the $-15$).
2.  **Square Root Property:** Apply $\pm\sqrt{}$ to both sides to remove the exponent.
3.  **Isolate the Variable:** Solve the resulting linear equations for the two final answers.
### 📝 Solving a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square ($x^2 + 16x + 14 = 0$)

The equation to solve is:
$$x^2 + 16x + 14 = 0$$

The coefficients are $a=1$, $b=16$, and $c=14$.

#### 1. Isolate the Constant Term

Move the constant term ($c$) to the right side of the equation:
$$x^2 + 16x = -14$$

#### 2. Complete the Square

To complete the square, find the value to add to both sides using the formula $\mathbf{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}$:

1.  Calculate $\frac{b}{2}$:
    $$\frac{16}{2} = 8$$
2.  Square the result:
    $$(8)^2 = 64$$

Add 64 to both sides of the equation:
$$x^2 + 16x + 64 = -14 + 64$$
$$x^2 + 16x + 64 = 50$$

#### 3. Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial

Factor the left side into a squared binomial, which is $\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2$:
$$(x + 8)^2 = 50$$

#### 4. Apply the Square Root Property

Take the square root of both sides, remembering the $\pm$ sign:
$$x + 8 = \pm \sqrt{50}$$

#### 5. Simplify the Radical

Simplify the radical $\sqrt{50}$ by factoring out the largest perfect square (25):
$$\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 2} = 5\sqrt{2}$$

Substitute the simplified radical back into the equation:
$$x + 8 = \pm 5\sqrt{2}$$

#### 6. Isolate $x$

Subtract 8 from both sides to get the final solution:
$$x = -8 \pm 5\sqrt{2}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = -8 + 5\sqrt{2} \text{ and } x = -8 - 5\sqrt{2}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

**Completing the Square** is the preferred method when the $a$ coefficient is 1 and the $b$ coefficient is an even number. The solution is always written by moving the final constant to the front of the $\pm$ term, resulting in the form $\mathbf{x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \text{simplified radical}}$.
### 📝 Solving $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ by Completing the Square ($5x^2 - 8x - 21 = 0$)

The equation to solve is:
$$5x^2 - 8x - 21 = 0$$

The coefficients are $a=5$, $b=-8$, and $c=-21$.

#### 1. Make the Leading Coefficient $a=1$

Divide the entire equation by $a=5$:
$$\frac{5x^2}{5} - \frac{8x}{5} - \frac{21}{5} = 0$$
$$x^2 - \frac{8}{5}x - \frac{21}{5} = 0$$

#### 2. Isolate the Variable Terms

Move the constant term to the right side of the equation:
$$x^2 - \frac{8}{5}x = \frac{21}{5}$$

#### 3. Complete the Square

Calculate the value to add to both sides using $\mathbf{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}$:

1.  Calculate $\frac{b}{2}$:
    $$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{8}{5}\right) = -\frac{4}{5}$$
2.  Square the result:
    $$\left(-\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{25}$$

Add $\frac{16}{25}$ to both sides. To add the fractions on the right, convert $\frac{21}{5}$ to a denominator of 25: $\frac{21 \cdot 5}{5 \cdot 5} = \frac{105}{25}$.

$$x^2 - \frac{8}{5}x + \frac{16}{25} = \frac{105}{25} + \frac{16}{25}$$
$$x^2 - \frac{8}{5}x + \frac{16}{25} = \frac{121}{25}$$

#### 4. Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial

Factor the left side into the form $\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2$:
$$\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{121}{25}$$

#### 5. Apply the Square Root Property

Take the square root of both sides, remembering the $\pm$ sign:
$$x - \frac{4}{5} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{121}{25}}$$
$$x - \frac{4}{5} = \pm \frac{11}{5}$$

#### 6. Isolate $x$ and Find Solutions

Add $\frac{4}{5}$ to both sides:
$$x = \frac{4}{5} \pm \frac{11}{5}$$

* **Solution 1 (using +):**
    $$x_1 = \frac{4 + 11}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = \mathbf{3}$$

* **Solution 2 (using -):**
    $$x_2 = \frac{4 - 11}{5} = \frac{-7}{5} = \mathbf{-\frac{7}{5}}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 3 \text{ and } x = -\frac{7}{5}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the leading coefficient $\mathbf{a \ne 1}$, the first step in Completing the Square **must** be to divide the entire equation by $a$. This introduces fractions (like $-\frac{8}{5}$ and $-\frac{21}{5}$), requiring careful calculation of $\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$ and proper fraction addition. The benefit is that the resulting factorable square term $\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2$ is immediately ready for the Square Root Property.

### 🧠 Derivation of the Quadratic Formula (Using Completing the Square)

The goal is to solve the generic standard form equation for $x$:
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

#### 1. Isolate the Variable Terms and Make $a=1$

First, move the constant term ($c$) to the right side:
$$ax^2 + bx = -c$$

Next, divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient ($a$) so that the $x^2$ term has a coefficient of 1:
$$\frac{ax^2}{a} + \frac{bx}{a} = -\frac{c}{a}$$
$$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}$$

---

#### 2. Complete the Square

Identify the coefficient of the $x$ term, which is $\frac{b}{a}$. Calculate the value required to complete the square using $\mathbf{\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{coefficient}\right)^2}$:

1.  Calculate half of the $x$-coefficient:
    $$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{b}{2a}$$
2.  Square the result:
    $$\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$

Add this value to **both sides** of the equation:
$$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} = -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$

---

#### 3. Factor the Perfect Square and Combine Terms

Factor the left side into a squared binomial, $\left(\mathbf{x + \frac{b}{2a}}\right)^2$:
$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$

Combine the fractions on the right side using the common denominator $\mathbf{4a^2}$:
$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c \cdot (4a)}{a \cdot (4a)} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$
$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{-4ac}{4a^2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$
$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$$

---

#### 4. Apply the Square Root Property

Take the square root of both sides, remembering the $\pm$ sign:
$$x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$$

Simplify the denominator of the radical ($\sqrt{4a^2} = 2a$):
$$x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

---

#### 5. Isolate $x$ (The Final Formula)

Subtract $\frac{b}{2a}$ from both sides. Since the denominators are the same ($2a$), combine the terms:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$$

This is the **Quadratic Formula**. 

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

The derivation shows that the Quadratic Formula is simply the **end result** of applying the **Completing the Square** method to a generic quadratic equation. The term $\mathbf{b^2 - 4ac}$ is known as the **discriminant** ($\Delta$) and determines the nature of the solutions (real or complex).
### 🧠 The Discriminant ($\Delta$) and the Nature of Solutions

The discriminant is the expression found under the radical in the Quadratic Formula. It determines the number and type of roots (solutions) for any quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

- **Discriminant** : $\Delta = \mathbf{b^2 - 4ac}$ : Will let you know what type of solution you have.

---

#### 1. Three Types of Solutions

| Value of $\mathbf{\Delta}$ | Name of Solution | Interpretation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **$\Delta > 0$** (Positive) | **Two Distinct Real Solutions** | The parabola crosses the x-axis at **two** different points. |
| **$\Delta = 0$** (Zero) | **One Real Solution** (A repeated root) | The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly **one** point (the vertex). |
| **$\Delta < 0$** (Negative) | **Two Complex Conjugate Solutions** | The parabola **does not cross** the x-axis. The solutions involve the imaginary unit $i$. |

---

#### 2. Extra Notes and Key Takeaways

* **Real Solution** : Solutions that do not involve the imaginary unit $i$.
    * If $\Delta$ is a **Perfect Square** (e.g., 4, 9, 16, 25...), the two real solutions will be **rational** (can be written as a fraction).
    * If $\Delta$ is **Not a Perfect Square** (e.g., 5, 7, 10, 11...), the two real solutions will be **irrational** (will involve a radical).

* **Complex Solution** : Solutions that involve the imaginary unit $i$ (i.e., the square root of a negative number). These always occur in **conjugate pairs** ($a+bi$ and $a-bi$).
### 📝 Solving a Quadratic Equation Using the Formula ($2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0$)

The equation to solve is:
$$2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0$$

The equation is already in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with the coefficients:
* $a = 2$
* $b = -5$
* $c = 3$

#### 1. State the Formula and Substitute Values

The Quadratic Formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Substitute the coefficients:
$$x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(3)}}{2(2)}$$

#### 2. Simplify the Discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$)

Simplify the terms under the square root:
$$\text{Discriminant} = 25 - 24$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Discriminant} = 1}$$

Since the discriminant is $\mathbf{1}$ (a positive perfect square), the equation has two distinct rational solutions.

#### 3. Calculate the Solutions

Substitute the simplified discriminant back into the formula:
$$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{4}$$
$$x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{4}$$

* **Solution 1 (using +1):**
    $$x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \mathbf{\frac{3}{2}}$$

* **Solution 2 (using -1):**
    $$x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = \mathbf{1}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{3}{2} \text{ and } x = 1$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

If the discriminant ($\mathbf{b^2 - 4ac}$) is a **perfect square** greater than zero, the quadratic equation is actually **factorable**, and the solutions will always be rational numbers.
### 📝 Solving $8x^2 + 6 = 0$ Using the Quadratic Formula

The equation is in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with the coefficients:
* $a = 8$
* $b = 0$
* $c = 6$

#### 1. State the Formula and Substitute Values

The Quadratic Formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Substitute the coefficients $a=8$, $b=0$, and $c=6$:
$$x = \frac{-(0) \pm \sqrt{(0)^2 - 4(8)(6)}}{2(8)}$$

#### 2. Simplify the Discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$)

Calculate the term under the square root:
$$\text{Discriminant} = 0 - 192$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Discriminant} = -192}$$

Since the discriminant is negative ($\Delta < 0$), the equation has two complex conjugate solutions.

#### 3. Calculate and Simplify the Solutions

Substitute the simplified discriminant back into the formula:
$$x = \frac{0 \pm \sqrt{-192}}{16}$$
$$x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{-192}}{16}$$

Simplify the imaginary radical $\sqrt{-192}$ by factoring out $i = \sqrt{-1}$ and the largest perfect square factor of 192 ($\sqrt{192} = \sqrt{64 \cdot 3} = 8\sqrt{3}$):
$$\sqrt{-192} = i\sqrt{192} = 8i\sqrt{3}$$

Substitute the simplified radical and reduce the fraction:
$$x = \pm \frac{8i\sqrt{3}}{16}$$
$$x = \pm \frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i \text{ and } x = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the $x$ term ($bx$) is missing (i.e., $b=0$), the simplest method for solving $ax^2 + c = 0$ is usually the **Square Root Property** (isolating $x^2$ and taking the square root).

If the constant term ($c$) is positive, solving for $x^2$ will result in a negative number, immediately telling you the solution will be a pair of **complex conjugates**.
### 📝 Solving $14x^2 - x + 9 = -4x + 9x^2$ Using the Quadratic Formula

#### 1. Rearrange into Standard Form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)

Move all terms to the left side of the equation to set it equal to zero:

* **Move $9x^2$**: $14x^2 - 9x^2 - x + 9 = -4x + 9x^2 - 9x^2$
    $$5x^2 - x + 9 = -4x$$
* **Move $-4x$**: $5x^2 - x + 4x + 9 = -4x + 4x$
    $$\mathbf{5x^2 + 3x + 9 = 0}$$

The coefficients are: $a = 5$, $b = 3$, and $c = 9$.

#### 2. Apply the Quadratic Formula and Substitute Values

The Quadratic Formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Substitute the coefficients $a=5$, $b=3$, and $c=9$:
$$x = \frac{-(3) \pm \sqrt{(3)^2 - 4(5)(9)}}{2(5)}$$

#### 3. Simplify the Discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$)

Calculate the term under the square root:
$$\text{Discriminant} = 9 - 4(45)$$
$$\text{Discriminant} = 9 - 180$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Discriminant} = -171}$$

Since the discriminant is negative ($\Delta < 0$), the equation has two complex conjugate solutions.

#### 4. Calculate and Simplify the Solutions

Substitute the simplified discriminant back into the formula:
$$x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{-171}}{10}$$

Simplify the imaginary radical $\sqrt{-171}$ by factoring out $i = \sqrt{-1}$. Find the largest perfect square factor of 171 ($171 = 9 \cdot 19$):
$$\sqrt{-171} = i\sqrt{171} = i\sqrt{9 \cdot 19} = 3i\sqrt{19}$$

Substitute the simplified radical:
$$x = \frac{-3 \pm 3i\sqrt{19}}{10}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{-3 + 3i\sqrt{19}}{10} \text{ and } x = \frac{-3 - 3i\sqrt{19}}{10}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Always begin by putting the equation in **standard form** ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$). When the discriminant ($\Delta$) is negative, the solution will have a **real part** ($-\frac{b}{2a}$) and an **imaginary part** ($\frac{\pm i\sqrt{|\Delta|}}{2a}$), which are separated over the common denominator.
### 📝 Solving $x^2 + 8x - 25 = -6$ Using the Quadratic Formula

#### 1. Rearrange into Standard Form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)

Add 6 to both sides of the equation:
$$x^2 + 8x - 25 + 6 = -6 + 6$$
$$\mathbf{x^2 + 8x - 19 = 0}$$

The coefficients are: $a = 1$, $b = 8$, and $c = -19$.

#### 2. Apply the Quadratic Formula and Substitute Values

The Quadratic Formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Substitute the coefficients $a=1$, $b=8$, and $c=-19$:
$$x = \frac{-(8) \pm \sqrt{(8)^2 - 4(1)(-19)}}{2(1)}$$

#### 3. Simplify the Discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$)

Calculate the term under the square root:
$$\text{Discriminant} = 64 - 4(-19)$$
$$\text{Discriminant} = 64 + 76$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Discriminant} = 140}$$

Since the discriminant is positive but not a perfect square, the equation has two distinct irrational solutions.

#### 4. Calculate and Simplify the Solutions

Substitute the simplified discriminant back into the formula:
$$x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{140}}{2}$$

Simplify the radical $\sqrt{140}$ by finding the largest perfect square factor ($140 = 4 \cdot 35$):
$$\sqrt{140} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 35} = 2\sqrt{35}$$

Substitute the simplified radical:
$$x = \frac{-8 \pm 2\sqrt{35}}{2}$$

Divide both terms in the numerator by the denominator (2):
$$x = \frac{-8}{2} \pm \frac{2\sqrt{35}}{2}$$
$$\mathbf{x = -4 \pm \sqrt{35}}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = -4 + \sqrt{35} \text{ and } x = -4 - \sqrt{35}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the final expression is in the form $\mathbf{\frac{A \pm B\sqrt{C}}{D}}$, you must check if the numbers A, B, and D share a common factor to fully simplify the answer (in this case, 8, 2, and 2 all share a factor of 2, allowing for simplification). The solutions are **irrational conjugates**.
### 📝 Solving $-9x^2 - 4x + 8 = 4$ Using the Quadratic Formula

#### 1. Rearrange into Standard Form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)

Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to set it equal to zero:
$$-9x^2 - 4x + 8 - 4 = 0$$
$$\mathbf{-9x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0}$$

The coefficients are: $a = -9$, $b = -4$, and $c = 4$.

#### 2. Apply the Quadratic Formula and Substitute Values

The Quadratic Formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Substitute the coefficients $a=-9$, $b=-4$, and $c=4$:
$$x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(-9)(4)}}{2(-9)}$$

#### 3. Simplify the Discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$)

Calculate the term under the square root:
$$\text{Discriminant} = 16 - 4(-36)$$
$$\text{Discriminant} = 16 + 144$$
$$\mathbf{\text{Discriminant} = 160}$$

Since the discriminant is positive but not a perfect square, the equation has two distinct irrational solutions.

#### 4. Calculate and Simplify the Solutions

Substitute the simplified discriminant back into the formula:
$$x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{160}}{-18}$$

Simplify the radical $\sqrt{160}$ by finding the largest perfect square factor ($160 = 16 \cdot 10$):
$$\sqrt{160} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 10} = 4\sqrt{10}$$

Substitute the simplified radical:
$$x = \frac{4 \pm 4\sqrt{10}}{-18}$$

Divide all terms by the common factor, 2, and move the negative sign from the denominator to the numerator (which flips the signs):
$$x = \frac{4 \div 2 \pm 4\sqrt{10} \div 2}{-18 \div 2}$$
$$x = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{10}}{-9}$$

Multiply the numerator by $-1$ to remove the negative sign in the denominator:
$$x = \frac{-(2 \pm 2\sqrt{10})}{9} = \frac{-2 \mp 2\sqrt{10}}{9}$$

Since $\pm$ and $\mp$ represent the same set of solutions, we write the final form:
$$\mathbf{x = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{10}}{9}}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{10}}{9} \text{ and } x = \frac{-2 - 2\sqrt{10}}{9}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the **leading coefficient ($a$) is negative**, it's usually best to keep the negative sign in the denominator ($2a$). In the final step, simplify by dividing all terms by a common factor, and then distribute the negative sign from the denominator into the numerator to present the final answer in a standard format.

## Algebra II - Lesson 64 - Solving Equations that are Quadratic in Form - 22November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=27h49m55s
- **Quadratic in Form** : $9x^4 + 3x^2 -20 = 0$ : $ax^2 + bx^1 + c = 0$ : When a non-quadratic equation can be written as a quadratic equation, we say it is quadratic in form - you could make a substitution and create a quadratic equation, solve it in the same way you solve a quadratic equation - 3 terms where $ax^2$  is double the exponent or $bx^1$   with a constant 
- **Quadratic Formula** : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ : a universal tool that provides the solutions (or roots) for any quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx+c=0$ , regardless of whether the solutions are real or complex.
- Instead of 2 solutions, you will often times get 4
### 📝 Solving Quadratic-in-Form: $9x^4 + 3x^2 - 20 = 0$

This equation is quadratic in form because the exponent of the leading term ($x^4$) is double the exponent of the middle term ($x^2$).

#### 1. Perform U-Substitution

Let the variable substitution be $\mathbf{z = x^2}$.
Then, $\mathbf{z^2 = (x^2)^2 = x^4}$.

Substitute $z$ and $z^2$ into the original equation:
$$9z^2 + 3z - 20 = 0$$

#### 2. Solve the Quadratic Equation for $z$

Use the Quadratic Formula with coefficients $a=9$, $b=3$, and $c=-20$:
$$z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$z = \frac{-(3) \pm \sqrt{(3)^2 - 4(9)(-20)}}{2(9)}$$

* **Simplify the Discriminant**:
    $$\Delta = 9 - 4(-180) = 9 + 720 = 729$$
* **Calculate the Solutions for $z$**:
    $$z = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{729}}{18}$$
    $$z = \frac{-3 \pm 27}{18}$$

    * $z_1 = \frac{-3 + 27}{18} = \frac{24}{18} = \mathbf{\frac{4}{3}}$
    * $z_2 = \frac{-3 - 27}{18} = \frac{-30}{18} = \mathbf{-\frac{5}{3}}$

#### 3. Substitute Back and Solve for $x$

Now, substitute $x^2$ back in for $z$ and solve for $x$ using the Square Root Property ($\mathbf{x = \pm \sqrt{z}}$).

* **Case 1: $z = \frac{4}{3}$**
    $$x^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{4}}{\sqrt{3}} = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$
    Rationalize the denominator:
    $$x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

* **Case 2: $z = -\frac{5}{3}$**
    $$x^2 = -\frac{5}{3}$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{5}{3}} = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}}$$
    Rationalize the denominator:
    $$x = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{5}\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}} = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{15}}{3}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}, x = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}, x = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{3}i, \text{ and } x = -\frac{\sqrt{15}}{3}i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

A fourth-degree polynomial equation ($x^4$) will have **four** roots, which may be real or complex. The U-substitution technique reduces the complexity to a standard quadratic, but you must remember the final step: **un-substitute** ($x^2=z$) and take the square root to find all four $x$ values. When $z$ is negative, the resulting $x$ values are always **complex**.
### 📝 Solving Quadratic-in-Form: $8x^4 + 10x^2 - 25 = 0$

#### 1. Perform Q-Substitution

This equation is quadratic in form. Use the substitution $\mathbf{q = x^2}$ and $\mathbf{q^2 = x^4}$ to transform it into a standard quadratic equation:
$$8q^2 + 10q - 25 = 0$$

#### 2. Solve the Quadratic Equation for $q$

Use the Quadratic Formula with coefficients $a=8$, $b=10$, and $c=-25$:
$$q = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
$$q = \frac{-(10) \pm \sqrt{(10)^2 - 4(8)(-25)}}{2(8)}$$

* **Simplify the Discriminant**:
    $$\Delta = 100 - 4(-200) = 100 + 800 = 900$$
* **Calculate the Solutions for $q$**:
    $$q = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{900}}{16}$$
    $$q = \frac{-10 \pm 30}{16}$$

    * $q_1 = \frac{-10 + 30}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = \mathbf{\frac{5}{4}}$
    * $q_2 = \frac{-10 - 30}{16} = \frac{-40}{16} = \mathbf{-\frac{5}{2}}$

#### 3. Substitute Back and Solve for $x$

Substitute $x^2$ back in for $q$ and solve for $x$ using the Square Root Property ($\mathbf{x = \pm \sqrt{q}}$).

* **Case 1: $q = \frac{5}{4}$**
    $$x^2 = \frac{5}{4}$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{4}}$$
    $$x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

* **Case 2: $q = -\frac{5}{2}$**
    $$x^2 = -\frac{5}{2}$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{5}{2}} = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}}$$
    Rationalize the denominator:
    $$x = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{5}\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}} = \pm i \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}, x = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}, x = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}i, \text{ and } x = -\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When solving quadratic-in-form equations, the $\mathbf{u/q}$-substitution method allows you to use familiar quadratic techniques. The final four roots will consist of **two real roots** (from $q>0$) and **two complex conjugate roots** (from $q<0$).
### 📝 Solving Quadratic-in-Form: $3x^4 - 24x^2 - 27 = 0$

#### 1. Simplify the Equation

Notice that all coefficients (3, -24, -27) are divisible by 3. Divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:
$$\frac{3x^4}{3} - \frac{24x^2}{3} - \frac{27}{3} = 0$$
$$\mathbf{x^4 - 8x^2 - 9 = 0}$$

#### 2. Perform U-Substitution

Let the substitution be $\mathbf{u = x^2}$.
Then, $\mathbf{u^2 = x^4}$.

Substitute $u$ and $u^2$ into the simplified equation:
$$u^2 - 8u - 9 = 0$$

#### 3. Solve the Quadratic Equation for $u$ (Factoring Method)

Since the discriminant will be a perfect square, this equation can be solved easily by **factoring** or using the quadratic formula. Given that $a=1$, factoring is fastest:
We need two numbers that multiply to $c=-9$ and add to $b=-8$. These numbers are $-9$ and $1$.
$$(u - 9)(u + 1) = 0$$

Set each factor to zero to find the solutions for $u$:
* $u - 9 = 0 \implies \mathbf{u_1 = 9}$
* $u + 1 = 0 \implies \mathbf{u_2 = -1}$

#### 4. Substitute Back and Solve for $x$

Substitute $x^2$ back in for $u$ and solve for $x$ using the Square Root Property ($\mathbf{x = \pm \sqrt{u}}$).

* **Case 1: $u = 9$**
    $$x^2 = 9$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{9}$$
    $$x = \pm 3$$

* **Case 2: $u = -1$**
    $$x^2 = -1$$
    $$x = \pm \sqrt{-1}$$
    $$x = \pm i$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 3, x = -3, x = i, \text{ and } x = -i$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Always check for a **common factor** to simplify the quadratic-in-form equation before beginning substitution. This makes the factoring or Quadratic Formula calculations much easier. This type of equation, which factors perfectly, yields **two real integer roots** and **two complex integer roots** (imaginary numbers without a radical).
### 📝 Solving Quadratic-in-Form: $2(3x + 2)^2 - 12(3x + 2) - 32 = 0$

#### 1. Simplify the Equation

Notice that all coefficients (2, -12, -32) are divisible by 2. Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
$$\frac{2(3x + 2)^2}{2} - \frac{12(3x + 2)}{2} - \frac{32}{2} = 0$$
$$\mathbf{(3x + 2)^2 - 6(3x + 2) - 16 = 0}$$

#### 2. Perform G-Substitution

Let the substitution be $\mathbf{g = 3x + 2}$.
Then, $\mathbf{g^2 = (3x + 2)^2}$.

Substitute $g$ and $g^2$ into the simplified equation:
$$g^2 - 6g - 16 = 0$$

#### 3. Solve the Quadratic Equation for $g$ (Factoring Method)

This equation can be solved quickly by factoring. We need two numbers that multiply to $c=-16$ and add to $b=-6$. These numbers are $-8$ and $2$.
$$(g - 8)(g + 2) = 0$$

Set each factor to zero to find the solutions for $g$:
* $g - 8 = 0 \implies \mathbf{g_1 = 8}$
* $g + 2 = 0 \implies \mathbf{g_2 = -2}$

#### 4. Substitute Back and Solve for $x$

Substitute $3x + 2$ back in for $g$ and solve the two resulting linear equations for $x$.

* **Case 1: $g = 8$**
    $$3x + 2 = 8$$
    $$3x = 8 - 2$$
    $$3x = 6$$
    $$x = \frac{6}{3}$$
    $$\mathbf{x_1 = 2}$$

* **Case 2: $g = -2$**
    $$3x + 2 = -2$$
    $$3x = -2 - 2$$
    $$3x = -4$$
    $$\mathbf{x_2 = -\frac{4}{3}}$$

$$\text{Solutions: } x = 2 \text{ and } x = -\frac{4}{3}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the substitution is a complex linear expression (like $3x+2$), the solutions for $x$ will not involve square roots unless the solutions for the substitution variable ($g$) are themselves negative or non-perfect squares. After finding the values for $g$, the original problem is reduced to solving two simple **linear equations**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=28h15m50s
- The graph of any quadratic equation is a *parabola*
- $f(x) = x^2$ : every input you put into x will get squared, creating a parabola shape as you plot the points - $f(x)$ is just 'y' 
- Graphing Parabolas is more difficult than linear graphing, you will either need a graphing calculator or a graphing software like desmos
- **Origin** = (0, 0)
- **Vertex** = The lowest or highest point on your graph (peak)
- **Shift** : $f(x) = x^2 + 3$ : just square 'x' and add '3' to get 'y', it *shifts* the position up by 3 units - it reminds me of 'y = mx + b'
- **Vertical Shift** : $f(x) = x^2 + k$ : When working with parabolas - you will shift 'up' $k$ units if $k > 0$ - or shift down |k| units if $k< 0$ - The *vertex* for a function in this form occurs at (0, k)
- **Horizontal Shift** : $f(x) = (x-1)^2$ : This creates a horizontal shift to the right by 1 unit of 'x' - The 'x' value needs to be one unit larger to gain the same value - the *vertex* shifts by the amount added or subtracted to 'x' before squaring, 'negative-subtract' goes to the right(positive side), while 'positive+add' shifts left(negative side) (counterintuitive)
  - $f(x) = (x-h)^2$ : When Working with parabolas, $h >0$ will be shifted $h$ units right - $h<0$ will be shifted |$h$| units left - the *Vertex* for a function of this form occurs at ($h$, 0) - What number can you plug in to 'x' that will give you '0'? That's the *vertex*
- $f(x) = (x-2)^2 + 3$ : In tougher examples, we combine a vertical and horizontal shift. (for the verex, shift right 2 - Shift up 3)
- $f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k : a \ne 0$ : The vertex occurs at (h, k), vertical line of 'x = h' as its axis, the graph opens up if a > 0 and down if a < 0
- $f(x) = -x^2$ : inverts/flips the parabola (it faces downwards) - If you have a negative coefficeint on the squard variable, it's inverted
## Algebra II - Lesson 66 - More on Parabolas - 23November2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=28h40m35s
- **Standard Form** : $f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c$ 
- **Vertex Form** : $a(x-h)^2 + k$ 
- **Vertex Formula** (from standard form) : $\mathbf{f(x) = a\left(x - \left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}\right)}$ : The expressions for the vertex components are: * **$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$,** $k = \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}$ : You can just plug in values now that you have the formula
- Be very careful with signs, if '-h' is not a negative number (addition sign instead) it would be a '-'negative' vertex
- When the leading coefficent for the $x^2$ term is not zero, you need to divide the $x^2 x^1$ terms by the coefficient AND also the number you are ADDING and SUBTRACTING from the 'completing the square' process 
- **Graphing Quadratic Equations** : 
  1) if $a > 0$ the parabola opens up : if $a < 0$ the parabola opens down 
  2) First, Locate the vertex $(h,k) = (x,y)$ : $a(x-h)^2 + k$ 
  3) Plot the incercepts set $f(x) = 0$ to find 'x intercept', set $f(0)$ to find the y-intercept (replace the 'x' in the standard form equation with '0')  : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ <- use that to find 'x'
  4) Plot additional points as needed
  5) Sketch the graph
### 📝 Concept Explanation: Why We Complete the Square

The reason we **cut the x¹ coefficient in half and square it** when converting a quadratic function from standard form to vertex form is to create a **Perfect Square Trinomial (PST)**, which is the necessary step for the method called **Completing the Square**.

#### 1. The Goal: Transforming the Form

The objective is to take the **Standard Form**:
$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$
And convert it into the **Vertex Form**:
$$f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$$
The key to the vertex form is the squared binomial, $(x - h)^2$.

#### 2. The Algebraic Template

The steps are derived from the formula for squaring a binomial:
$$(x + d)^2 = x^2 + \mathbf{2d}x + \mathbf{d^2}$$

We are trying to force the terms $x^2 + \mathbf{b}x$ to match the pattern $x^2 + \mathbf{2d}x$.

* **Why We Divide by 2 (Finding d):**
    By comparing the coefficient of $x$ in the standard form ($b$) and the template ($2d$), we see:
    $$\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{2d}$$
    Solving for $d$ (the value needed inside the factored binomial):
    $$d = \frac{b}{2}$$
    We divide $b$ by 2 to find the number ($d$) that must go inside the parentheses of the factored square: $(x + d)^2$.

* **Why We Square It (Finding $d^2$):**
    The Perfect Square Trinomial requires a constant term equal to $d^2$. Since $d = \frac{b}{2}$, the required constant term is:
    $$\mathbf{d^2} = \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$$
    We square the result to calculate the specific number that must be **added** to the expression to mathematically complete the $x^2 + bx$ portion, allowing it to be factored perfectly into $\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2$.

---

#### 💡 Example: Converting $f(x) = x^2 + 10x + 3$

| Step | Action | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Find $b$** | $b = 10$ |
| **2. Cut in Half** | Find $d$ (the term in the binomial). | $d = \frac{10}{2} = \mathbf{5}$ |
| **3. Square It** | Find $d^2$ (the constant to add). | $d^2 = (5)^2 = \mathbf{25}$ |
| **4. Algebra** | Add and subtract 25 to complete the square: | $f(x) = (x^2 + 10x + \mathbf{25}) + 3 - \mathbf{25}$ |
| **5. Factor & Simplify** | Factor the PST and combine constants: | $f(x) = (x + 5)^2 - 22$ |

* **Resulting Vertex Form**: $f(x) = (x + 5)^2 - 22$.

---

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The entire process is a technique to force $x^2 + bx$ to fit the algebraic template of a squared binomial $(x+d)^2$.

* **Divide by 2** ($\frac{b}{2}$): Finds the term ($d$) that belongs inside the factored square.
* **Square it** ($\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2$): Calculates the constant term ($d^2$) required to complete the trinomial so it can be factored.
### 📝 Deriving the Vertex Form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ from $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$

The vertex form reveals the vertex $(h, k)$ immediately. We use **Completing the Square** on the general standard form to find the expressions for $h$ and $k$.

#### 1. Group Terms and Factor out 'a'

Factor the leading coefficient, **$a$**, out of the $x^2$ and $x$ terms only:
$$f(x) = a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x\right) + c$$

#### 2. Prepare to Complete the Square (Explicit Calculation)

Identify the new $x$ coefficient, $b' = \frac{b}{a}$. To complete the square, we need to calculate $\left(\frac{b'}{2}\right)^2$. This is done by taking the $x$ coefficient, multiplying by $\frac{1}{2}$ (or dividing by 2), and then squaring the result:

1.  **Multiply by $\frac{1}{2}$** (finding the term $d$):
    $$\frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{b}{2a}$$
2.  **Square the result** (finding the constant $d^2$):
    $$\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$

#### 3. Complete the Square

Add and subtract the required term $\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$ **inside** the parentheses:
$$f(x) = a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right) + c$$

#### 4. Move the Subtracted Term Outside

Move the subtracted term $\left(-\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)$ outside the parentheses. Since it was inside the group factored by **$a$**, it must be multiplied by $a$ when moved outside:
$$f(x) = a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right) + c - a\left(\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)$$

Simplify the term outside: $a \cdot \frac{b^2}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2}{4a}$:
$$f(x) = a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right) + c - \frac{b^2}{4a}$$

#### 5. Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial

Factor the trinomial inside the parentheses into the squared binomial $\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$:
$$f(x) = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a}$$

#### 6. Combine the Constants (Derive $k$)

Combine the constant terms outside the parentheses to derive the expression for $k$. Find a common denominator, $4a$:
$$f(x) = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{4ac}{4a} - \frac{b^2}{4a}$$
$$f(x) = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}$$

#### 7. Final Vertex Form ($h$ and $k$)

By matching this result to the target form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$:
$$\mathbf{f(x) = a\left(x - \left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}\right)}$$

The expressions for the vertex components are:
* **$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$**
* **$k = \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}$**

---

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The step-by-step calculation shows that dividing the new $x$ coefficient $\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$ by two is equivalent to multiplying it by $\frac{1}{2}$, yielding $\frac{b}{2a}$. Squaring this result $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$ provides the exact term $\left(\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)$ required to complete the square.
### 📝 The Discriminant and Types of Solutions

The image displays the three conditions for the **discriminant**, which is the expression found **under the radical** sign in the Quadratic Formula: $\mathbf{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac}$.

The discriminant determines the nature (real or complex) and the number of solutions (roots or x-intercepts) for any quadratic equation in standard form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$). 

---

#### 1. Three Conditions of the Discriminant

The sign of the discriminant tells us everything about the solutions:

* **Case 1: $b^2 - 4ac > 0$** (Positive Discriminant)
    * **Result:** **Two Real Solutions** (The graph, a parabola, crosses the x-axis twice.)
    * **Explanation:** Since the value under the square root is positive, the Quadratic Formula will result in two different real numbers: $x = \frac{-b \pm (\text{a positive real number})}{2a}$.

* **Case 2: $b^2 - 4ac = 0$** (Zero Discriminant)
    * **Result:** **One Real Solution** (or two identical real solutions) (The parabola touches the x-axis exactly once at the vertex.)
    * **Explanation:** Since the value under the square root is zero, the $\pm$ term disappears: $x = \frac{-b \pm 0}{2a}$. This leaves only one unique real solution: $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$.

* **Case 3: $b^2 - 4ac < 0$** (Negative Discriminant)
    * **Result:** **No Real Solution** (The parabola never crosses the x-axis; it floats entirely above or below it.)
    * **Explanation:** Since the value under the square root is negative, the solutions involve $\sqrt{\text{a negative number}}$, meaning they are **two complex conjugate solutions** (involving the imaginary unit $i$).

---

#### 💡 Example: $2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0$ (image\_655d5c.png)

* **Coefficients:** $a=2, b=-5, c=3$
* **Calculate $\Delta$:**
    $$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
    $$\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(2)(3)$$
    $$\Delta = 25 - 24$$
    $$\Delta = 1$$
* **Result:** Since $\mathbf{\Delta = 1 > 0}$, the equation has **two distinct real solutions**.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The discriminant is the **quickest test** to determine the fundamental nature of the roots of any quadratic equation before you commit to solving the entire equation. If you get a negative discriminant, you immediately know the roots are complex.
### 📝 Converting Standard Form to Vertex Form: $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 10$

The goal is to convert $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 10$ to the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

#### 1. Group Variable Terms

Group the $x^2$ and $x$ terms together. Since $a=1$, no division is required.
$$f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) - 10$$

#### 2. Complete the Square

Identify the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b=3$. Calculate the value to add and subtract using $\mathbf{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}$:

1.  Calculate $\frac{b}{2}$:
    $$\frac{3}{2}$$
2.  Square the result:
    $$\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}$$

Add and subtract this value inside the function:
$$f(x) = \left(x^2 + 3x + \frac{9}{4}\right) - 10 - \frac{9}{4}$$

#### 3. Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial

Factor the terms inside the parentheses into a squared binomial, $\left(\mathbf{x + \frac{b}{2}}\right)^2$:
$$f(x) = \left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 10 - \frac{9}{4}$$

#### 4. Combine the Constants

Find a common denominator for the constants on the right side. Convert $-10$ to $-\frac{40}{4}$:
$$f(x) = \left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{40}{4} - \frac{9}{4}$$
$$f(x) = \left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{-40 - 9}{4}$$
$$\mathbf{f(x) = \left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{4}}$$

This is the **Vertex Form** of the function.

$$\text{Vertex: } (h, k) = \left(-\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{49}{4}\right)$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When converting to vertex form, the number you add to **complete the square** inside the parentheses must be **subtracted** immediately outside the parentheses to keep the function equivalent to the original. If you use the alternative method of $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$, you get $h = -\frac{3}{2(1)} = -\frac{3}{2}$, which confirms the $h$-value found by completing the square.
### 📝 Converting Standard Form to Vertex Form: $f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 7$

The goal is to convert the standard form $f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x + 7$ to the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

#### 1. Factor out the Leading Coefficient ($a$)

Factor out the coefficient $a=3$ from the $x^2$ and $x$ terms only:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x\right) + 7$$

#### 2. Complete the Square

Identify the new $x$ coefficient, $b' = \frac{5}{3}$. Calculate the value to add and subtract using $\mathbf{\left(\frac{b'}{2}\right)^2}$:

1.  Calculate $\frac{b'}{2}$ (dividing a fraction by 2 is the same as multiplying the denominator by 2):
    $$\frac{5}{3} \div 2 = \frac{5}{6}$$
2.  Square the result:
    $$\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}$$

Add and subtract this value **inside** the parentheses:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x + \frac{25}{36} - \frac{25}{36}\right) + 7$$

#### 3. Move the Subtracted Term Outside

Move the subtracted term $\left(-\frac{25}{36}\right)$ outside the parentheses. Remember that it must be **multiplied** by the factored coefficient, $a=3$:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x + \frac{25}{36}\right) + 7 - 3\left(\frac{25}{36}\right)$$

Simplify the term outside: $3\left(\frac{25}{36}\right) = \frac{75}{36}$. Reducing the fraction $\frac{75}{36}$ by 3 gives $\frac{25}{12}$:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x + \frac{25}{36}\right) + 7 - \frac{25}{12}$$

#### 4. Factor the Perfect Square Trinomial

Factor the terms inside the parentheses into a squared binomial, $\left(\mathbf{x + \frac{b'}{2}}\right)^2$:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x + \frac{5}{6}\right)^2 + 7 - \frac{25}{12}$$

#### 5. Combine the Constants

Find a common denominator for the constants on the right side. Convert $7$ to $\frac{84}{12}$:
$$f(x) = 3\left(x + \frac{5}{6}\right)^2 + \frac{84}{12} - \frac{25}{12}$$
$$f(x) = 3\left(x + \frac{5}{6}\right)^2 + \frac{84 - 25}{12}$$
$$\mathbf{f(x) = 3\left(x + \frac{5}{6}\right)^2 + \frac{59}{12}}$$

This is the **Vertex Form** of the function.

$$\text{Vertex: } (h, k) = \left(-\frac{5}{6}, \frac{59}{12}\right)$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the **leading coefficient ($a$) is not 1**, you must **factor it out** of the variable terms before completing the square. Remember that the term you subtract outside the parentheses must be multiplied by $a$ to correctly balance the equation. This process is guaranteed to reveal the vertex $(h, k)$.
### 📝 Converting to Vertex Form using the Vertex Formula: $f(x) = 8x^2 + 16x - 7$

The goal is to convert $f(x) = 8x^2 + 16x - 7$ to the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

#### 1. Identify Coefficients and $a$

Identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the standard form:
$$a = 8, \quad b = 16, \quad c = -7$$

#### 2. Calculate the $x$-coordinate of the Vertex ($h$)

Use the vertex formula for $h$:
$$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

Substitute $a=8$ and $b=16$:
$$h = -\frac{16}{2(8)}$$
$$h = -\frac{16}{16}$$
$$\mathbf{h = -1}$$

#### 3. Calculate the $y$-coordinate of the Vertex ($k$)

The $y$-coordinate $k$ is found by substituting the $h$-value back into the original function: $\mathbf{k = f(h)}$.
$$k = f(-1) = 8(-1)^2 + 16(-1) - 7$$

$$k = 8(1) - 16 - 7$$
$$k = 8 - 16 - 7$$
$$k = -8 - 7$$
$$\mathbf{k = -15}$$

#### 4. Write the Vertex Form

Substitute $a=8$, $h=-1$, and $k=-15$ into the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$:
$$f(x) = 8(x - (-1))^2 + (-15)$$
$$\mathbf{f(x) = 8(x + 1)^2 - 15}$$

The vertex is $\mathbf{(-1, -15)}$.

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When the leading coefficient $\mathbf{a \neq 1}$, the $\mathbf{a}$ value carries directly over to the vertex form $f(x) = \mathbf{a}(x - h)^2 + k$. Using the vertex formula, $h = -\frac{b}{2a}$, is often the fastest way to solve these problems, particularly when $b$ is a multiple of $2a$, resulting in a simple integer $h$-value.
### 📝 Converting to Vertex Form using the Vertex Formula: $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 6$

The goal is to convert $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 6$ to the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.

#### 1. Identify Coefficients and $a$

Identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the standard form:
$$a = 3, \quad b = -4, \quad c = 6$$

#### 2. Calculate the $x$-coordinate of the Vertex ($h$)

Use the vertex formula for $h$:
$$h = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

Substitute $a=3$ and $b=-4$:
$$h = -\frac{(-4)}{2(3)}$$
$$h = \frac{4}{6}$$
$$\mathbf{h = \frac{2}{3}}$$

#### 3. Calculate the $y$-coordinate of the Vertex ($k$)

The $y$-coordinate $k$ is found by substituting the $h$-value back into the original function: $\mathbf{k = f(h)}$.
$$k = f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 3\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 6$$

* **Simplify the squared term:**
    $$3\left(\frac{4}{9}\right) = \frac{12}{9} = \frac{4}{3}$$

* **Simplify the linear term:**
    $$-4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{8}{3}$$

* **Substitute back and combine:**
    $$k = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{8}{3} + 6$$
    $$k = -\frac{4}{3} + 6$$

* **Combine constants (use common denominator 3):**
    $$k = -\frac{4}{3} + \frac{18}{3}$$
    $$\mathbf{k = \frac{14}{3}}$$

#### 4. Write the Vertex Form

Substitute $a=3$, $h=\frac{2}{3}$, and $k=\frac{14}{3}$ into the vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$:
$$\mathbf{f(x) = 3\left(x - \frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{14}{3}}$$

The vertex is $\mathbf{\left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{14}{3}\right)}$.

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

When using the vertex formula and $h$ is a fraction (as often happens when $b$ is not a multiple of $2a$), the calculation for $k$ requires careful **fraction arithmetic** to substitute the fraction value back into the original function and simplify the constants. This method is mathematically equivalent to completing the square.
### 📝 Finding the Number of X-Intercepts using the Discriminant: $f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 10$

The discriminant ($\mathbf{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac}$) tells us the nature and number of real solutions (x-intercepts) for a quadratic equation.

#### 1. Identify Coefficients

First, identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the standard form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$:
$$a = 5$$
$$b = -3$$
$$c = 10$$

#### 2. Calculate the Discriminant ($\Delta$)

Substitute the values into the discriminant formula:
$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
$$\Delta = (-3)^2 - 4(5)(10)$$
$$\Delta = 9 - 200$$
$$\mathbf{\Delta = -191}$$

#### 3. Determine the Number of X-Intercepts

The rule for the discriminant is:
* If $\Delta > 0$, there are two real solutions (two x-intercepts).
* If $\Delta = 0$, there is one real solution (one x-intercept).
* If $\mathbf{\Delta < 0}$, there are **no real solutions** (zero x-intercepts).

Since the calculated discriminant is $\mathbf{\Delta = -191}$, which is less than zero, the function has **no real solutions**.

$$\text{Conclusion: The function has 0 x-intercepts.}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

A **negative discriminant** ($\Delta < 0$) indicates that the parabola never intersects the x-axis. The solutions to the corresponding equation ($5x^2 - 3x + 10 = 0$) would be **two complex conjugate numbers**, meaning there are no *real* roots.
### 📝 Finding the Number of X-Intercepts using the Discriminant: $f(x) = -7x^2 - 2x + 1$

The discriminant ($\mathbf{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac}$) tells us the nature and number of real solutions (x-intercepts) for a quadratic equation.

#### 1. Identify Coefficients

First, identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the standard form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$:
$$a = -7$$
$$b = -2$$
$$c = 1$$

#### 2. Calculate the Discriminant ($\Delta$)

Substitute the values into the discriminant formula:
$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
$$\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(-7)(1)$$
$$\Delta = 4 - (-28)$$
$$\Delta = 4 + 28$$
$$\mathbf{\Delta = 32}$$

#### 3. Determine the Number of X-Intercepts

The rules for the discriminant are:
* If $\mathbf{\Delta > 0}$, there are **two distinct real solutions** (two x-intercepts).
* If $\Delta = 0$, there is one real solution (one x-intercept).
* If $\Delta < 0$, there are no real solutions (zero x-intercepts).

Since the calculated discriminant is $\mathbf{\Delta = 32}$, which is greater than zero, the function has **two distinct real solutions**.

$$\text{Conclusion: The function has 2 x-intercepts.}$$

***

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway

A **positive discriminant** ($\Delta > 0$) guarantees that the parabola will cross the x-axis at two different points, regardless of whether the parabola opens up ($a>0$) or down ($a<0$). Since $a=-7$ here, the parabola opens down, but it still has two real roots.

- **Quadratic Inequality** : $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$ : $a \ne 0$ : Similar to linear expressions, this is what a quadratic ineuqality is, just replace the '=' equals sign with a '>' '<' '$\le$' '$\ge$'sign
- **Solving a Quadratic Inequality** : 
  1) Write the inequality as an equation and solve
  2) These solutions will set up the intervals on the number line
  3) We substitute a test point from each interval into the original inequality
  4) The endpoints are included in the solution set for a non-strict inequality and excluded for a strict inequality
- The easeiest **Test Point** to use is '0' - You can use multiple test points for multiple intervals(since quadratic have multiple answers in the {solution set}) if the number you plug into the test point for 'x' is 'true' it is part of the solution set, if 'false' it is not part of the solution set -  The 'Solutions' will show the 'x Intercept(s)' on the graph for your parabola - He took each solution in the solutions set and created intervals on a numberline and then did a test point on each interval to prove true or false then write an equation like $\mathbf{\left(-\infty, \frac{1}{3}\right) \cup (3, \infty)}$ or $\mathbf{\left\{x \mid x < \frac{1}{3} \text{ or } x > 3\right\}}$ to show where the boundary points/x intercepts are, and where to shade
- **Boundary Points** = Where you go from a solution region to a non-solution region
- The shading(where to shade) and lines(dashed vs straight line) are similar to *Linear Inequalities*
- Just using a graphing calculator/software, bro. (Tedious AF to graph and shade everything corectly)
- Remember to **reverse the inequality sign** (from $>$ to $<$) when dividing by a negative coefficient 
- **Solving a Rational Inequality** : 
  1) Write the inequality such that '0' is on one side and a single fraction is on the other
  2) Find all value that make the numerator or denominator 0 ( any value that creates a 0 denominator is excluded from the solution set)
  3) Use the values to create intervals on the number line
  4) Test a number from each interval to determine the solution set
  5) Endpoints are included when they do not make the denominator zero, and we have a non-strict inequality
### 📝 Solving Quadratic Inequality using the Quadratic Formula: $3x^2 - 10x + 3 > 0$

To solve the inequality $3x^2 - 10x + 3 > 0$, we first find the critical points (roots) by solving the equality $3x^2 - 10x + 3 = 0$ using the Quadratic Formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

#### 1. Identify Coefficients and Calculate Roots

* **Coefficients:** $a = 3$, $b = -10$, $c = 3$.
* **Calculate Discriminant ($\Delta$):**
    $$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
    $$\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4(3)(3)$$
    $$\Delta = 100 - 36$$
    $$\Delta = 64$$

* **Apply Quadratic Formula:**
    $$x = \frac{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2(3)}$$
    $$x = \frac{10 \pm 8}{6}$$

* **Find Critical Point 1 ($x_1$):**
    $$x_1 = \frac{10 + 8}{6} = \frac{18}{6}$$
    $$\mathbf{x_1 = 3}$$

* **Find Critical Point 2 ($x_2$):**
    $$x_2 = \frac{10 - 8}{6} = \frac{2}{6}$$
    $$\mathbf{x_2 = \frac{1}{3}}$$

The critical points are $\mathbf{x = \frac{1}{3}}$ and $\mathbf{x = 3}$.

#### 2. Parabola Analysis

Now we analyze the graph of $f(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 3$ to determine the intervals where $f(x) > 0$.

1.  **Shape:** Since $a = 3$ is positive, the parabola opens **upwards**.
2.  **Roots:** The parabola crosses the $x$-axis at $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=3$.
3.  **Inequality Check:** We are looking for where $f(x) > 0$ (where the parabola is **above** the $x$-axis).
    * Since the parabola opens up, it is above the $x$-axis on the segments **outside** its roots. 
#### 3. State the Solution

The solution includes all $x$-values less than the smaller root or greater than the larger root. Since the inequality is strictly greater than ($>$), the endpoints are not included.

* **Interval Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\left(-\infty, \frac{1}{3}\right) \cup (3, \infty)}$$

* **Set Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\left\{x \mid x < \frac{1}{3} \text{ or } x > 3\right\}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When solving a quadratic inequality using the formula, the formula's primary role is to find the **critical points** quickly. The final step always involves testing the intervals or analyzing the parabola's shape and position relative to the $x$-axis to determine the correct solution set.
### 📝 Solving Quadratic Inequality using the Quadratic Formula: $-2x^2 - 5x + 96 > -9x$

The goal is to find the $x$-intervals where the inequality is true.

#### 1. Rearrange to Standard Form

Move terms to one side and simplify the inequality:
$$-2x^2 - 5x + 96 > -9x$$
$$\text{Add } 9x \text{ to both sides:}$$
$$-2x^2 + 4x + 96 > 0$$

To simplify the parabola analysis, divide by $-2$. **(Reverse the inequality sign):**
$$\mathbf{x^2 - 2x - 48 < 0}$$
We solve the equality $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$ for the critical points.

#### 2. Find the Critical Points (Roots)

We use the Quadratic Formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ with coefficients $a=1$, $b=-2$, $c=-48$.

* **Calculate Discriminant ($\Delta$):**
    $$\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48)$$
    $$\Delta = 4 + 192 = 196$$

* **Apply Quadratic Formula:**
    $$x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{196}}{2(1)}$$
    $$x = \frac{2 \pm 14}{2}$$

* **Find Roots:**
    $$x_1 = \frac{2 + 14}{2} = 8$$
    $$x_2 = \frac{2 - 14}{2} = -6$$

The critical points (roots) are $\mathbf{x = -6}$ and $\mathbf{x = 8}$.

#### 3. Parabola Analysis and Solution

We analyze the inequality $\mathbf{x^2 - 2x - 48 < 0}$.

1.  **Shape:** Since $a=1$ is positive, the parabola opens **upwards**.
2.  **Inequality Check:** The inequality requires the function to be **less than 0** ($< 0$), which means we look for the region where the upward-opening parabola is **below** the $x$-axis.
3.  This region is the **inner interval** between the roots.

* **Interval Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{(-6, 8)}$$

* **Set Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\{x \mid -6 < x < 8\}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

Remember to **reverse the inequality sign** (from $>$ to $<$) when dividing by a negative coefficient (like dividing by $-2$ in Step 1). The final solution is determined by analyzing the sign of the simplified quadratic ($x^2 - 2x - 48$) and its associated parabola.
### 📝 Solving Rational Inequality: $\frac{x + 1}{x + 3} > 5$

The goal is to find the intervals of $x$ that satisfy the inequality. We cannot cross-multiply by $(x+3)$ because we don't know if it's positive or negative.

#### 1. Rearrange to Standard Form

Move all terms to one side so the inequality is set to zero, then find a common denominator:
$$\frac{x + 1}{x + 3} - 5 > 0$$

* **Rewrite 5 with the common denominator $(x+3)$:**
    $$5 = 5 \cdot \frac{x + 3}{x + 3} = \frac{5(x + 3)}{x + 3}$$

* **Combine the fractions:**
    $$\frac{x + 1}{x + 3} - \frac{5(x + 3)}{x + 3} > 0$$
    $$\frac{(x + 1) - (5x + 15)}{x + 3} > 0$$
    $$\frac{x + 1 - 5x - 15}{x + 3} > 0$$
    $$\mathbf{\frac{-4x - 14}{x + 3} > 0}$$

#### 2. Find Critical Points (Zeros and Undefined Points)

The critical points are the values that make the numerator or the denominator equal to zero.

* **Numerator Critical Point (Zero):**
    $$-4x - 14 = 0$$
    $$-4x = 14$$
    $$x = -\frac{14}{4}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -\frac{7}{2} \text{ or } -3.5}$$

* **Denominator Critical Point (Undefined Point):**
    $$x + 3 = 0$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -3}$$

#### 3. Perform Sign Analysis

The critical points $x = -3.5$ and $x = -3$ divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -3.5)$, $(-3.5, -3)$, and $(-3, \infty)$. We check the sign of the full rational expression $\frac{-4x - 14}{x + 3}$ in each interval.

| Interval | Test Value ($x$) | Numerator Sign ($-4x - 14$) | Denominator Sign ($x + 3$) | Fraction Sign ($\frac{\text{Num}}{\text{Den}}$) | $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} > 0$ (True/False) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $(-\infty, -3.5)$ | $x=-4$ | Positive (2) | Negative (-1) | Negative (-) | **FALSE** |
| **$(-3.5, -3)$** | **$x=-3.25$** | **Positive (1)** | **Positive (0.25)** | **Positive (+)** | **TRUE** |
| $(-3, \infty)$ | $x=0$ | Negative (-14) | Positive (3) | Negative (-) | **FALSE** |

#### 4. State the Solution

The solution is the interval where the fraction is positive ($> 0$). We use parentheses for the endpoints because the inequality is strictly greater than ($>$) and the denominator is always excluded.

* **Interval Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\left(-\frac{7}{2}, -3\right)}$$

* **Set Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\left\{x \mid -\frac{7}{2} < x < -3\right\}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The crucial first step in solving rational inequalities is always **rearranging the expression** so that one side is zero (Step 1). The final solution **must always exclude** any value that makes the denominator zero (in this case, $x \neq -3$), as the expression is undefined there.
### 📝 Solving Rational Inequality: $\frac{x - 2}{x + 2} \le 2$

The goal is to find the intervals of $x$ that satisfy the inequality. We must first rearrange it so that one side is zero.

#### 1. Rearrange to Standard Form $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \le 0$

Subtract 2 from both sides and find a common denominator:
$$\frac{x - 2}{x + 2} - 2 \le 0$$

* **Rewrite 2 with the common denominator $(x+2)$:**
    $$2 = 2 \cdot \frac{x + 2}{x + 2} = \frac{2(x + 2)}{x + 2}$$

* **Combine the fractions:**
    $$\frac{x - 2}{x + 2} - \frac{2(x + 2)}{x + 2} \le 0$$
    $$\frac{(x - 2) - (2x + 4)}{x + 2} \le 0$$
    $$\frac{x - 2 - 2x - 4}{x + 2} \le 0$$
    $$\mathbf{\frac{-x - 6}{x + 2} \le 0}$$

#### 2. Find Critical Points (Zeros and Undefined Points)

The critical points are the values that make the numerator or the denominator zero.

* **Numerator Critical Point (Zero):**
    $$-x - 6 = 0$$
    $$-x = 6$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -6}$$
    (This value *will* be included in the solution because of $\le$).

* **Denominator Critical Point (Undefined Point):**
    $$x + 2 = 0$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -2}$$
    (This value **must always be excluded** from the solution because the expression is undefined here).

#### 3. Perform Sign Analysis

The critical points $x = -6$ and $x = -2$ divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -6)$, $(-6, -2)$, and $(-2, \infty)$. We check the sign of the expression $\frac{-x - 6}{x + 2}$ in each interval.

| Interval | Test Value ($x$) | Numerator Sign ($-x - 6$) | Denominator Sign ($x + 2$) | Fraction Sign ($\frac{\text{Num}}{\text{Den}}$) | $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \le 0$ (True/False) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **$(-\infty, -6)$** | **$x=-7$** | **Positive (1)** | **Negative (-5)** | **Negative (-)** | **TRUE** |
| $(-6, -2)$ | $x=-3$ | Negative (-3) | Negative (-1) | Positive (+) | **FALSE** |
| **$(-2, \infty)$** | **$x=0$** | **Negative (-6)** | **Positive (2)** | **Negative (-)** | **TRUE** |

#### 4. State the Solution

The solution includes the intervals where the fraction is negative or zero.
* **$x = -6$** (from the numerator) is **included** (use brackets $[$).
* **$x = -2$** (from the denominator) is **excluded** (use parentheses $)$).

* **Interval Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{(-\infty, -6] \cup (-2, \infty)}$$

* **Set Notation:**
    $$\mathbf{\{x \mid x \le -6 \text{ or } x > -2\}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For rational inequalities involving $\le$ or $\ge$:
1.  **Numerator roots** are **included** (brackets).
2.  **Denominator roots** are **always excluded** (parentheses), as they cause division by zero.
3.  The final solution is determined by the intervals that match the inequality sign (negative for $\le 0$, positive for $\ge 0$).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=29h55m50s
- **Function** : $f(x)$ : A relation where each x- value corresponds to exactly one y-value - A function is allowed to have y-values that correspond to different x -values (multiple 'x' values can be the same 'y', but multiple 'y's can not be the same 'x' - each input(x) must have the same output(y) - *deterministic*)
- $(x,y)$ : 'x' represents the domain (allowable inputs), 'y' represents the range (outputs)
- **One-To-One Function** : Each *x-value* corresponds to ONE *y-value*  -Each *y-value* corresponds to ONE *x-value* - If you have a **One-To-One Function** you can create an **Inverse Function** by interchanging *x* and *y* 
- **Inverse Function** : $f^{-1}(x)$ : $(x,y) = (y,x)$ Your domain(x) becomes your range(y) and your range(y) becomes  your domain(x) - If you have a **One-To-One Function** you can create an **Inverse Function** by interchanging *x* and *y* - this is the notation to use an inverse function 'F Inverse' is how it's said, It's NOT a $f^{-1}$ negative one exponent($\frac{1}{f(x)}$) , It's an inverse function NOT AN EXPONENT 
- $f^{-1}$ consists of all ordered pairs (y,x) - where (x,y) are the components of $f$ 
- $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ : this equation is asking for 'what is y in the inverse' which is #(2) below - Plug into the original function to get 'x' : $f(\frac{x-3}{2}) = x$ 
- $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ : this equation is asking plugging in 'y' from the original equation to get x back : $f^{-1}(2x + 3) = x$  
- $f(x) =  y$ : in order to swap them $f(x) = 2x +3 : y = 2x +3 : x = 2y +3$ : $\frac{x-3}{2} = y$ : <- that is just the chain of cau
- sality and swapping f(x) -> y -> x -> then solve for 'y' to get the inverse So: your 2 equations would be :
  1) $f(x) = 2x + 3$ 
  2) $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x-3}{2}$ 
- If you want to check if a function is a one to one, simply check for duplicate x AND y values
- **Vertical Line Test** = How to test if something is a *One to one function* draw a straight line on a graph of your function, if it touches at any point twice, for each 'x' more than one 'y', it is not a one to one
- **Horizontal Line Test** = If any horizontal line intersects the graph of a function in no more than one spot, the function is one to one
### 📝 Inverse Function Composition: $\mathbf{f(f^{-1}(x)) = x}$ and $\mathbf{f^{-1}(f(x)) = x}$

These two equations define the property of **inverse functions**: when you compose a function with its inverse (in either order), the result is always the original input, $x$. This is called the **Identity Function**.

Let's use the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$.
#### 1. Find the Inverse Function $f^{-1}(x)$

First, we find the inverse of $f(x) = 2x + 3$.

1.  **Replace $f(x)$ with $y$**: $y = 2x + 3$
2.  **Swap $x$ and $y$**: $x = 2y + 3$
3.  **Solve for $y$**:
    $$x - 3 = 2y$$
    $$y = \frac{x - 3}{2}$$
4.  **Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$**: $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}}$

---

#### I. The Rule: $\mathbf{f(f^{-1}(x)) = x}$

**Concept:** This asks, "If I take an output from the inverse function and put it into the original function, I get back the original input $x$."

**Your Interpretation:** *This equation is asking for 'what is y in the inverse' which is #(2) below - Plug into the original function to get 'x'.* (This is essentially correct, as $f^{-1}(x)$ is the input to $f$.)

**Fully Worked Example:**

Given $f(x) = 2x + 3$ and $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}$, we substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f(x)$.

1.  **Substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f(x)$:**
    $$f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right)$$

2.  **Apply the rule for $f(x)$:** (Replace every $x$ in $2x + 3$ with $\frac{x - 3}{2}$)
    $$f\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right) + 3$$

3.  **Simplify:**
    $$f(f^{-1}(x)) = (x - 3) + 3$$
    $$\mathbf{f(f^{-1}(x)) = x}$$

---

#### II. The Rule: $\mathbf{f^{-1}(f(x)) = x}$

**Concept:** This asks, "If I take an output from the original function and put it into the inverse function, I get back the original input $x$."

**Your Interpretation:** *This equation is asking plugging in 'y' from the original equation to get x back.* (This is also correct, as $f(x)$ is the output of the original function and the input to $f^{-1}$.)

**Fully Worked Example:**

Given $f(x) = 2x + 3$ and $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}$, we substitute $f(x)$ into $f^{-1}(x)$.

1.  **Substitute $f(x)$ into $f^{-1}(x)$:**
    $$f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(2x + 3)$$

2.  **Apply the rule for $f^{-1}(x)$:** (Replace every $x$ in $\frac{x - 3}{2}$ with $2x + 3$)
    $$f^{-1}(2x + 3) = \frac{(2x + 3) - 3}{2}$$

3.  **Simplify:**
    $$f^{-1}(f(x)) = \frac{2x}{2}$$
    $$\mathbf{f^{-1}(f(x)) = x}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

If and only if **both** compositions result in $x$, the functions are true inverses. The order of composition does not matter—they "undo" each other perfectly, returning the original input. This property is used to **verify inverses**.
### 📝 Finding the Inverse Function: $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{-10 + 3x}{2}}$

The process of finding an inverse function, $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$, involves three main steps: 1) Replace $f(x)$ with $y$, 2) Swap $x$ and $y$, and 3) Solve for the new $y$.

#### 1. Set $f(x) = y$

Write the function using $y$:
$$y = \frac{-10 + 3x}{2}$$

#### 2. Swap $x$ and $y$

Exchange the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the equation:
$$x = \frac{-10 + 3y}{2}$$

#### 3. Solve for $y$ (Isolate the variable)

* **Multiply both sides by 2:**
    $$2x = -10 + 3y$$

* **Add 10 to both sides:**
    $$2x + 10 = 3y$$

* **Divide both sides by 3:**
    $$y = \frac{2x + 10}{3}$$

#### 4. State the Inverse Function

Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2x + 10}{3}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

Finding the inverse function essentially **reverses the order of operations**. The original function: $x \to \text{multiply by } 3 \to \text{subtract } 10 \to \text{divide by } 2$. The inverse function: $x \to \text{multiply by } 2 \to \text{add } 10 \to \text{divide by } 3$. This shows the inverse function uses inverse operations in the reverse order.
### 📝 Finding the Inverse Function: $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{-4x}{5}}$

The process of finding the inverse function, $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$, involves three main steps: 1) Replace $f(x)$ with $y$, 2) Swap $x$ and $y$, and 3) Solve for the new $y$.

#### 1. Set $f(x) = y$

Write the function using $y$:
$$y = \frac{-4x}{5}$$

#### 2. Swap $x$ and $y$

Exchange the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the equation:
$$x = \frac{-4y}{5}$$

#### 3. Solve for $y$ (Isolate the variable)

* **Multiply both sides by 5:**
    $$5x = -4y$$

* **Divide both sides by -4:**
    $$y = \frac{5x}{-4}$$
    $$y = -\frac{5x}{4}$$

#### 4. State the Inverse Function

Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = -\frac{5x}{4}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For linear functions, finding the inverse is simply performing the inverse operations in the reverse order.
The original function $f(x)$ takes $x$, multiplies it by $-\frac{4}{5}$.
The inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ takes $x$ and multiplies it by the reciprocal of $-\frac{4}{5}$, which is $\mathbf{-\frac{5}{4}}$.
### 📝 Finding the Inverse Function: $\mathbf{f(x) = x^3 - 2}$

The process for finding the inverse function, $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$, is: 1) Replace $f(x)$ with $y$, 2) Swap $x$ and $y$, and 3) Solve for the new $y$.

#### 1. Set $f(x) = y$

Write the function using $y$:
$$y = x^3 - 2$$

#### 2. Swap $x$ and $y$

Exchange the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the equation:
$$x = y^3 - 2$$

#### 3. Solve for $y$ (Isolate the variable)

* **Add 2 to both sides:**
    $$x + 2 = y^3$$

* **Take the cube root of both sides:**
    $$\sqrt[3]{x + 2} = y$$

#### 4. State the Inverse Function

Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x + 2}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The inverse of a cubing operation ($\mathbf{x^3}$) is the **cube root operation** ($\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{x}}$). This function $f(x)$ is defined for all real numbers and is one-to-one, meaning its inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ is also a function defined for all real numbers.
### 📝 Finding the Inverse Function: $\mathbf{f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} + 3}$

The process for finding the inverse function, $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$, is: 1) Replace $f(x)$ with $y$, 2) Swap $x$ and $y$, and 3) Solve for the new $y$.

#### 1. Set $f(x) = y$

Write the function using $y$:
$$y = \sqrt[3]{x} + 3$$

#### 2. Swap $x$ and $y$

Exchange the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the equation:
$$x = \sqrt[3]{y} + 3$$

#### 3. Solve for $y$ (Isolate the variable)

* **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
    $$x - 3 = \sqrt[3]{y}$$

* **Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:**
    $$(x - 3)^3 = (\sqrt[3]{y})^3$$
    $$(x - 3)^3 = y$$

#### 4. State the Inverse Function

Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = (x - 3)^3}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For functions involving roots, the final step in finding the inverse is often raising both sides to a power that matches the root's index. The inverse of **adding 3** and then **taking the cube root** is **subtracting 3** and then **cubing the result**.
### 📝 Finding the Inverse Function: $\mathbf{f(x) = \frac{3}{x - 1} - 2}$

The process for finding the inverse function, $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$, is: 1) Replace $f(x)$ with $y$, 2) Swap $x$ and $y$, and 3) Solve for the new $y$.

#### 1. Set $f(x) = y$

Write the function using $y$:
$$y = \frac{3}{x - 1} - 2$$

#### 2. Swap $x$ and $y$

Exchange the positions of $x$ and $y$ in the equation:
$$x = \frac{3}{y - 1} - 2$$

#### 3. Solve for $y$ (Isolate the variable)

* **Add 2 to both sides:**
    $$x + 2 = \frac{3}{y - 1}$$

* **Multiply by $(y - 1)$ to get $y$ out of the denominator:**
    $$(x + 2)(y - 1) = 3$$

* **Divide by $(x + 2)$:**
    $$y - 1 = \frac{3}{x + 2}$$

* **Add 1 to both sides:**
    $$y = \frac{3}{x + 2} + 1$$

#### 4. State the Inverse Function

Replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \frac{3}{x + 2} + 1}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For rational functions, the algebra to solve for $y$ involves isolating the term with $y$, often by cross-multiplication or by manipulating the terms until $y$ is isolated in the numerator.
* The original function has a vertical asymptote at $\mathbf{x=1}$ and a horizontal asymptote at $\mathbf{y=-2}$.
* The inverse function has a vertical asymptote at $\mathbf{x=-2}$ and a horizontal asymptote at $\mathbf{y=1}$.
The asymptotes of the inverse are simply the swapped values of the asymptotes of the original function.

- **Exponential Function** : $f(x) = a^x$ : $a > 0, a \ne 1$ where 'x' is any real number greater than 0 and 'a' is not 1
- **Graphing An Exponential Function** (don't, use a graphing calc) :
  1) Find Ordered Pairs (enough to show a good picture)
  2) Plot the points
  3) Connect the points with a smooth curve
- $f(x) = a^x$ : (0,1) = (x,y) any number raised to the power of '0' will always be a '1', so that (0,1) will be a point on the graph, this is why we must restrict a to be greater than 0, and not equal to 1 
- **Asymptote** : Exponential functions are *Asymptotes*, the graph approaches the x-axis, but will never touch it.
- *The Domain* : Inputs, Set of all allowable 'x' values consists of all real numbers $(-\infty, \infty)$
- *The Range* : Outputs, Set of all available 'y' values consists of all positive numbers $(0, \infty)$  
- *The Base* = 'a' : When 'a > 1', the graph rises from left to right - When '0 < a < 1', the graph will fall from left to right
- **Exponential Equation** :  $2^x = 16$  : Is an equation with a variable in the exponent - If $a^x = a^y$ Then 'x = y'
- **Solving an Exponential Equation** :
  1) Each side must have the same base
  2) Simplify the exponents
  3) Set the exponents equal to eachother
  4) Solve the resulting equation
  5) Check with substitution
### 📈 Exponential Function Value Map: $\mathbf{f(x) = 2^x}$

This chart maps the requested input values ($x$) to their corresponding output values ($f(x)$) for the base-2 exponential function.

| $x$ (Input) | Calculation ($f(x) = 2^x$) | $y$ (Output) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **-4** | $2^{-4} = \frac{1}{2^4}$ | $\mathbf{\frac{1}{16}}$ |
| **-1** | $2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}$ | $\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ |
| **0** | $2^0$ | $\mathbf{1}$ |
| **1** | $2^1$ | $\mathbf{2}$ |
| **3** | $2^3$ | $\mathbf{8}$ |

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

1.  **Zero Exponent:** Any non-zero base raised to the power of $\mathbf{0}$ is always $\mathbf{1}$. This means all exponential functions of the form $f(x) = b^x$ (where $b > 0$ and $b \neq 1$) pass through the point $(\mathbf{0, 1})$.
2.  **Negative Exponents:** A negative exponent results in the **reciprocal** of the base raised to the positive exponent. For example, $2^{-4} = \frac{1}{2^4}$.
### 📉 Exponential Function Value Map: $\mathbf{f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x}$

This chart maps the requested input values ($x$) to their corresponding output values ($f(x)$) for the base-$1/2$ exponential function, which demonstrates exponential decay.

| $x$ (Input) | Calculation ($f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x$) | $y$ (Output) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **-3** | $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3} = 2^3$ | $\mathbf{8}$ |
| **-1** | $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1} = 2^1$ | $\mathbf{2}$ |
| **0** | $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0$ | $\mathbf{1}$ |
| **1** | $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1$ | $\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ |
| **2** | $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$ | $\mathbf{\frac{1}{4}}$ |

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

1.  **Exponential Decay:** Because the base $\mathbf{b = \frac{1}{2}}$ is between $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ ($0 < b < 1$), this function represents **exponential decay**. As $x$ increases, the $y$-value decreases.
2.  **Negative Exponents:** A negative exponent results in the **reciprocal** of the base raised to the positive exponent. For example, $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3} = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^3 = 8$.
### 💡 Solving Exponential Equation: $\mathbf{2^{3x - 3} = 64}$

The goal is to solve for $x$ by equating the exponents after expressing both sides of the equation with the same base.

#### 1. Express Both Sides with the Same Base

We notice the base on the left is $\mathbf{2}$. We must determine what power of 2 equals 64:
$$2^1 = 2$$
$$2^2 = 4$$
$$2^3 = 8$$
$$2^4 = 16$$
$$2^5 = 32$$
$$2^6 = 64$$

Substitute $2^6$ for 64 in the original equation:
$$2^{3x - 3} = 2^6$$

#### 2. Equate the Exponents

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:
$$3x - 3 = 6$$

#### 3. Solve the Linear Equation for $x$

* **Add 3 to both sides:**
    $$3x = 6 + 3$$
    $$3x = 9$$

* **Divide by 3:**
    $$x = \frac{9}{3}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 3}$$

#### 4. Verification

Plug $x=3$ back into the original equation:
$$2^{3(3) - 3} = 2^{9 - 3} = 2^6 = 64$$
$$64 = 64$$
The solution is correct.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To solve exponential equations where the variable is in the exponent, the best strategy is often to find a **common base** for both sides. Once the bases are equal, the $\mathbf{One-to-One Property of Exponential Functions}$ allows you to set the exponents equal to each other, turning the exponential equation into a simpler linear or quadratic equation.
### 💡 Solving Exponential Equation: $\mathbf{\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^{3p} = 81}$

The goal is to solve for $p$ by expressing both the base $\frac{1}{9}$ and the number $81$ as powers of the common base $\mathbf{3}$.

#### 1. Express Both Sides with the Common Base 3

* **Rewrite the left side:**
    $$\frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3^2} = 3^{-2}$$
    Substitute this into the equation:
    $$\left(3^{-2}\right)^{3p} = 81$$

* **Rewrite the right side:**
    $$81 = 9^2 = (3^2)^2 = 3^{2 \cdot 2}$$
    $$\mathbf{81 = 3^4}$$

The equation becomes:
$$\left(3^{-2}\right)^{3p} = 3^4$$

#### 2. Simplify the Left Exponent

Use the power rule for exponents, $(b^m)^n = b^{m \cdot n}$:
$$3^{(-2)(3p)} = 3^4$$
$$3^{-6p} = 3^4$$

#### 3. Equate the Exponents and Solve for $p$

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal (One-to-One Property):
$$-6p = 4$$

* **Divide by -6:**
    $$p = \frac{4}{-6}$$
    $$\mathbf{p = -\frac{2}{3}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When solving exponential equations involving fractions, use the **negative exponent rule** ($b^{-m} = \frac{1}{b^m}$) to rewrite the fraction as a whole number base with a negative exponent. This enables you to find a common base for the entire equation.
### 💡 Solving Exponential Equation: $\mathbf{216^{-3b - 2} = 36}$

The goal is to solve for $b$ by expressing both sides with the common base $\mathbf{6}$.

#### 1. Express Both Sides with the Common Base 6

* **Rewrite the left side (216):**
    $$216 = 6 \cdot 36 = 6 \cdot 6^2 = 6^3$$
    Substitute this into the equation:
    $$\left(6^3\right)^{-3b - 2} = 36$$

* **Rewrite the right side (36):**
    $$\mathbf{36 = 6^2}$$

The equation becomes:
$$\left(6^3\right)^{-3b - 2} = 6^2$$

#### 2. Simplify the Left Exponent

Use the power rule for exponents, $(b^m)^n = b^{m \cdot n}$. Multiply the exponents:
$$6^{3(-3b - 2)} = 6^2$$
$$6^{-9b - 6} = 6^2$$

#### 3. Equate the Exponents and Solve for $b$

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal (One-to-One Property):
$$-9b - 6 = 2$$

* **Add 6 to both sides:**
    $$-9b = 2 + 6$$
    $$-9b = 8$$

* **Divide by -9:**
    $$b = \frac{8}{-9}$$
    $$\mathbf{b = -\frac{8}{9}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For equations with large bases like 216 and 36, look for the **greatest common base** (in this case, 6) that can express both numbers as powers. Once the bases are equal, the problem simplifies into solving a basic linear equation.
### 💡 Solving Exponential Equation: $\mathbf{64^{2 - 2x} \cdot 16^{-x - 1} = \frac{1}{4}}$

The goal is to solve for $x$ by expressing all bases (64, 16, and $\frac{1}{4}$) as powers of the common base $\mathbf{4}$.

#### 1. Express All Bases with the Common Base 4

* **Rewrite the left side bases:**
    $$64 = 4^3$$
    $$16 = 4^2$$

* **Rewrite the right side:**
    $$\frac{1}{4} = 4^{-1}$$

Substitute these into the original equation:
$$\left(4^3\right)^{2 - 2x} \cdot \left(4^2\right)^{-x - 1} = 4^{-1}$$

#### 2. Simplify Exponents using the Power Rule $(b^m)^n = b^{m \cdot n}$

Multiply the outer and inner exponents on the left side:
$$4^{3(2 - 2x)} \cdot 4^{2(-x - 1)} = 4^{-1}$$
$$4^{6 - 6x} \cdot 4^{-2x - 2} = 4^{-1}$$

#### 3. Combine Exponents using the Product Rule $b^m \cdot b^n = b^{m+n}$

Add the exponents on the left side:
$$4^{(6 - 6x) + (-2x - 2)} = 4^{-1}$$
$$4^{6 - 2 - 6x - 2x} = 4^{-1}$$
$$4^{4 - 8x} = 4^{-1}$$

#### 4. Equate the Exponents and Solve for $x$

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal (One-to-One Property):
$$4 - 8x = -1$$

* **Subtract 4 from both sides:**
    $$-8x = -1 - 4$$
    $$-8x = -5$$

* **Divide by -8:**
    $$x = \frac{-5}{-8}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{5}{8}}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For complicated exponential equations, the procedure is sequential:
1. **Common Base:** Find a base common to *all* terms (Step 1).
2. **Power Rule:** Simplify expressions with exponents raised to exponents (Step 2).
3. **Product/Quotient Rule:** Combine terms on each side into a single base (Step 3).
4. **Equate:** Set the resulting exponents equal to each other (Step 4).
### 💡 Solving Exponential Equation: $\mathbf{64^{3p + 3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2p} = 64^{-p - 3}}$

The goal is to solve for $p$ by expressing all bases (64 and $\frac{1}{8}$) as powers of the common base $\mathbf{8}$.

#### 1. Express All Bases with the Common Base 8

* **Rewrite 64:**
    $$64 = 8^2$$
* **Rewrite $\frac{1}{8}$:**
    $$\frac{1}{8} = 8^{-1}$$

Substitute these into the original equation:
$$\left(8^2\right)^{3p + 3} \cdot \left(8^{-1}\right)^{2p} = \left(8^2\right)^{-p - 3}$$

#### 2. Simplify Exponents using the Power Rule $(b^m)^n = b^{m \cdot n}$

Multiply the outer and inner exponents on both sides:
$$8^{2(3p + 3)} \cdot 8^{-1(2p)} = 8^{2(-p - 3)}$$
$$8^{6p + 6} \cdot 8^{-2p} = 8^{-2p - 6}$$

#### 3. Combine Exponents on the Left Side using the Product Rule $b^m \cdot b^n = b^{m+n}$

Add the exponents on the left side:
$$8^{(6p + 6) + (-2p)} = 8^{-2p - 6}$$
$$8^{4p + 6} = 8^{-2p - 6}$$

#### 4. Equate the Exponents and Solve for $p$

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal (One-to-One Property):
$$4p + 6 = -2p - 6$$

* **Add $2p$ to both sides (group $p$ terms):**
    $$6p + 6 = -6$$

* **Subtract 6 from both sides (group constant terms):**
    $$6p = -6 - 6$$
    $$6p = -12$$

* **Divide by 6:**
    $$p = \frac{-12}{6}$$
    $$\mathbf{p = -2}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For exponential equations with multiple terms and fractions, use the common base strategy:
1.  **Identify the simplest common base** (e.g., 8 is simpler than 2, as $8^2 = 64$).
2.  **Use negative exponents** for fractions ($\frac{1}{8} = 8^{-1}$).
3.  **Use exponent rules** (Power and Product) to simplify the equation to the form $b^A = b^B$, which allows you to solve the resulting linear equation $A = B$.
## Algebra II - Lesson 70 - Logarithmic Functions - 25November2025 : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=30h58m25s
- **Logarithmic Function** : $f(x) = \log_a(x)$ : $a > 0, x > 0, a \neq 1$ : **Base ($a$):** Must be a positive number and cannot be equal to 1. **Argument/Power/Result ($x$):** Must be strictly positive ($x > 0$), which defines the **domain** of the function. : 
- It is said 'Log base a of x' 
- The **Inverse** of an **Exponential Function** is a **Logarithmic Function** 
- $x = a^y$ (exponential form) is the same as $y = log_a(x)$ (logarithmic form)
- $\log_a(x)$ : Log Base 'a' of 'x' is just the exponent to which the base 'a' must be raised to, to obtain 'x' : $a^? = x$ 
- $\log_3(9)$ Log Basse 3 or 9 is asking what power '3' needs to be raised to to get '9' : $3^? = 9$ 
- **Properties of Logarithims** : $log_b(b) = 1$ : $log_b(1) = 0$ : $b > 0$, $b \ne 1$ : Log base 'b' of 'b' is equal to '1' because if you have a base 'b' and raise it to the power of '1' you get 'b' back : log base 'b' of '1' is equal to '0' because if you raise base 'b' to the power of '0' you get '1' back
- **Graphing A Logarithmic Function** :
  1) To graph a log, we put it in exponential form
  2) (1,0) is on the graph
  3) if 'a > 1', the graph rises from left to right
  4) if '0 < a < 1' the graph falls from left to right
  5) the graph approaches the y-axis, but does not touch it. It forms an asymptote
- **Domain** : $(0, \infty)$ : The Domain and Range have flipped (inverted exponential) for a logarithmic the domain is $(0, \infty)$ anything larger than zero, to infinity, and beyond
- **Range** : $(-\infty, \infty)$ : any real number

### 🔄 Finding the Inverse: Exponential to Logarithm

This process shows how to find the inverse of an exponential function by converting its form to a logarithm.

We will use the general exponential function: $\mathbf{f(x) = a^x}$

#### 1. Start with the Function and Swap $x$ and $y$

The standard exponential function is defined as:
$$\text{Original Function: } f(x) = a^x$$

* **Step 1a: Replace $f(x)$ with $y$**
    $$y = a^x$$
* **Step 1b: Swap $x$ and $y$** (This is the defining algebraic action for finding the inverse.)
    $$\mathbf{x = a^y}$$

---

#### 2. Solve for $y$ using the Logarithmic Definition

At this point, $y$ is trapped as an exponent. To solve for $y$, we must use the **definition of a logarithm**.

| Exponential Form | Logarithmic Form |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Base** $^{\text{Exponent}}$ **= Argument** | **Exponent = $\log_{\text{Base}}$ (Argument)** |

Applying this definition to our swapped equation $x = a^y$:

| $x = a^y$ | $\mathbf{y = \log_a(x)}$ |
| :---: | :---: |

---

#### 3. State the Inverse Function

The final result, after solving for $y$, is the inverse function $\mathbf{f^{-1}(x)}$:
$$\mathbf{f^{-1}(x) = \log_a(x)}$$

#### Fully Worked Example

Find the inverse of $\mathbf{f(x) = 5^{x}}$

1.  **Start:** $y = 5^x$
2.  **Swap:** $x = 5^y$
3.  **Log Definition:** $\mathbf{y = \log_5(x)}$
4.  **Inverse:** $f^{-1}(x) = \log_5(x)$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

* The inverse of an exponential function is a **logarithmic function** with the **same base ($\mathbf{a}$)**.
* The **domain** of the exponential function ($\mathbf{-\infty, \infty}$) becomes the **range** of the logarithmic function.
* The **range** of the exponential function ($y > 0$) becomes the **domain** of the logarithmic function ($\mathbf{x > 0}$). The argument of a logarithm can never be zero or negative.
### 🔄 Converting Exponential Form to Logarithmic Form ($\mathbf{4^2 = 16}$)

The logarithmic form is simply another way to write an exponential relationship. It asks the question: "**To what power do I raise the base to get the argument?**"

#### 1. General Conversion Rule

| Form | Equation | Breakdown |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Exponential** | $$\mathbf{a^y = x}$$ | The **base** ($a$) raised to the **exponent** ($y$) equals the **argument** ($x$). |
| **Logarithmic** | $$\mathbf{y = \log_a(x)}$$ | The **exponent** ($y$) equals the logarithm, base **base** ($a$), of the **argument** ($x$). |

---

#### 2. Worked Example

Convert the numerical exponential equation $\mathbf{4^2 = 16}$ into logarithmic form (image\_92ea90.png).

1.  **Identify Components:**
    * Base ($\mathbf{a}$) = 4
    * Exponent ($\mathbf{y}$) = 2
    * Argument ($\mathbf{x}$) = 16

2.  **Apply Conversion ($y = \log_a(x)$):**
    $$\mathbf{2 = \log_4(16)}$$

**Interpretation:** The log expression asks, "To what power must 4 be raised to equal 16?" The answer is 2.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The logarithm is fundamentally the **exponent**. When you convert $a^y = x$ to $\log_a(x) = y$, you are isolating the exponent ($y$) on one side. This conversion is vital for solving exponential equations when bases cannot be easily matched.
### 🔄 Converting Exponential Form: $\mathbf{5^3 = 125}$ to Logarithmic Form

The logarithmic form is fundamentally the **inverse operation** of the exponential form. It isolates the exponent, asking, "**To what power must the base be raised to get the argument?**"

#### 1. General Conversion Rule

The general rule for conversion is:
$$\mathbf{\text{Exponential Form: } a^y = x \quad \iff \quad \text{Logarithmic Form: } y = \log_a(x)}$$

| Term | Role in Exponential ($a^y = x$) | Role in Logarithmic ($\log_a(x) = y$) | Value in Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Base** | $a$ | $a$ (subscript) | 5 |
| **Exponent** | $y$ | $y$ (isolated) | 3 |
| **Argument** | $x$ | $x$ (inside log) | 125 |

---

#### 2. Worked Example Conversion

Convert the numerical exponential equation $\mathbf{5^3 = 125}$ into logarithmic form.

* **Identify:** Base $a=5$, Exponent $y=3$, Argument $x=125$.
* **Apply Rule ($y = \log_a(x)$):**
    $$\mathbf{3 = \log_5(125)}$$

**Interpretation:** The log expression asks, "To what power must **5** be raised to equal **125**?" The answer is **3**.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The $\mathbf{\text{logarithm IS the exponent}}$. This relationship is crucial because it allows you to solve for unknown exponents, which is impossible using only basic algebra. When converting, always ensure the **base** of the exponentiation becomes the **base** of the logarithm.
### 🔄 Converting Exponential Form: $\mathbf{10^{-2} = \frac{1}{100}}$ to Logarithmic Form

The logarithmic form is fundamentally the **inverse operation** of the exponential form. It isolates the exponent, asking, "**To what power must the base be raised to get the argument?**"

#### 1. General Conversion Rule

The general rule for conversion is:
$$\mathbf{\text{Exponential Form: } a^y = x \quad \iff \quad \text{Logarithmic Form: } y = \log_a(x)}$$

|     Term     | Role in Exponential ($a^y = x$) | Role in Logarithmic ($\log_a(x) = y$) | Value in Example |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|   **Base**   |               $a$               |            $a$ (subscript)            |        10        |
| **Exponent** |               $y$               |            $y$ (isolated)             |        -2        |
| **Argument** |               $x$               |           $x$ (inside log)            | $\frac{1}{100}$  |

---

#### 2. Worked Example Conversion

Convert the numerical exponential equation $\mathbf{10^{-2} = \frac{1}{100}}$ into logarithmic form.

* **Identify:** Base $a=10$, Exponent $y=-2$, Argument $x=\frac{1}{100}$.
* **Apply Rule ($y = \log_a(x)$):**
    $$\mathbf{-2 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)}$$

**Note on Common Logarithms:** Since the base is 10, this is the **Common Logarithm**. It is often written without the subscript:
$$\mathbf{-2 = \log\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)}$$

**Interpretation:** The log expression asks, "To what power must **10** be raised to equal **1/100**?" The answer is **-2**.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

A **negative exponent** in the exponential form translates to a **negative result** in the logarithmic form. The base 10 logarithm ($\log_{10}$) is commonly used in science and engineering and is often denoted as just $\log$.
### 💡 Solving Logarithmic Equation: $\mathbf{3 = \log_{10}(3x)}$

The goal is to solve for $x$ by converting the equation from logarithmic form to exponential form.

#### 1. Analyze the Logarithmic Form

The equation is already in the isolated form $\mathbf{y = \log_a(x)}$.

* **Original Equation:** $\mathbf{3 = \log_{10}(3x)}$
* **Identify Components:**
    * Base ($\mathbf{a}$) = 10
    * Exponent ($\mathbf{y}$) = 3
    * Argument ($\mathbf{x}$ in the formula, which is $\mathbf{3x}$ here)

---

#### 2. Convert to Exponential Form

We use the conversion rule: $\mathbf{y = \log_a(\text{Argument}) \iff a^y = \text{Argument}}$.

* **Apply Conversion:**
    $$10^3 = 3x$$

---

#### 3. Solve the Resulting Linear Equation for $x$

* **Calculate $10^3$:**
    $$1000 = 3x$$

* **Divide by 3:**
    $$\mathbf{x = \frac{1000}{3}}$$

#### 4. Final Solution and Domain Check

The solution to the equation is $\mathbf{x = \frac{1000}{3}}$.

**Domain Check:**
The argument of the logarithm, $3x$, must be strictly positive: $\mathbf{3x > 0}$.
Since $\frac{1000}{3}$ is a positive value, $3\left(\frac{1000}{3}\right) = 1000$, which is $> 0$. The solution is valid.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To solve any logarithmic equation of the form $\mathbf{\log_a(\text{expression}) = y}$:
1.  **Isolate** the logarithm (which is already done here).
2.  **Use the Logarithmic Definition** to convert it into the exponential relationship: $\mathbf{a^y = \text{expression}}$.
3.  **Solve** the simplified equation.
4.  Always **verify your solution** by ensuring the argument of the original logarithm is positive. If $3x \le 0$, the solution would be extraneous.
### 💡 Solving Logarithmic Equation: $\mathbf{\log_5(-4x + 5) = 2}$

The goal is to solve for $x$ by converting the equation from logarithmic form to exponential form and then solving the resulting linear equation.

#### 1. Convert to Exponential Form

Recall the conversion rule: $\mathbf{\log_a(\text{Argument}) = y \iff a^y = \text{Argument}}$.

* **Identify Components:**
    * Base ($\mathbf{a}$) = 5
    * Exponent ($\mathbf{y}$) = 2
    * Argument = $\mathbf{-4x + 5}$

* **Apply Conversion ($a^y = \text{Argument}$):**
    $$5^2 = -4x + 5$$

---

#### 2. Solve the Resulting Linear Equation for $x$

* **Calculate $5^2$:**
    $$25 = -4x + 5$$

* **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
    $$25 - 5 = -4x$$
    $$20 = -4x$$

* **Divide by -4:**
    $$x = \frac{20}{-4}$$
    $$\mathbf{x = -5}$$

#### 3. Final Solution and Domain Check

The solution is $\mathbf{x = -5}$.

**Domain Check:**
The argument of the logarithm, $-4x + 5$, must be strictly positive: $\mathbf{-4x + 5 > 0}$.

Substitute $x = -5$ into the argument:
$$-4(-5) + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25$$
Since $25 > 0$, the solution $\mathbf{x = -5}$ is valid.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To solve any isolated logarithmic equation, **convert to its exponential equivalent**. After finding a potential solution, it is **mandatory** to check it in the original equation to ensure the argument of the logarithm remains **positive**. If the argument were zero or negative, the solution would be extraneous (not valid).
### 💡 Solving Logarithmic Equation: $\mathbf{\log_{27}(\sqrt[4]{81}) = x}$

The goal is to solve for $x$ by converting both the base (27) and the argument ($\sqrt[4]{81}$) to powers of the common base 3, and then using the Change of Base Formula.

#### 1. Express Base and Argument with Common Base 3

* **Rewrite the Base (27):**
    $$27 = 3^3$$

* **Rewrite the Argument ($\sqrt[4]{81}$):**
    First, $81 = 3^4$.
    Second, convert the root to a rational exponent: $\sqrt[n]{b} = b^{1/n}$.
    $$\sqrt[4]{81} = \sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3^{4/4} = 3^1 = 3$$

Wait, let's recheck that last simplification. If we look at $81 = 3^4$, then $\sqrt[4]{81}$ is indeed 3. However, solving this type of problem is easier by keeping the exponent form until the end.
$$\sqrt[4]{81} = (3^4)^{1/4} = 3^{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = 3^1$$

Let's proceed by converting the whole expression into powers of 3:
$$\log_{27}(\sqrt[4]{81}) = x$$
$$\log_{3^3}(3^1) = x$$

---

#### 2. Use the Change of Base Formula and Logarithm Properties

We can solve this directly using the property $\mathbf{\log_{a^n}(a^m) = \frac{m}{n}}$.

* **Identify Components:**
    * Base exponent ($\mathbf{n}$) = 3
    * Argument exponent ($\mathbf{m}$) = 1

* **Apply Property:**
    $$x = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{3}$$

Alternatively, using the **Change of Base Formula** ($\mathbf{\log_a(x) = \frac{\log_b(x)}{\log_b(a)}}$) with $b=3$:
$$x = \frac{\log_3(\sqrt[4]{81})}{\log_3(27)}$$
$$x = \frac{\log_3(3^1)}{\log_3(3^3)}$$

Now use the property $\mathbf{\log_b(b^n) = n}$:
$$x = \frac{1}{3}$$

#### 3. Final Solution

The solution is $\mathbf{x = \frac{1}{3}}$.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

For equations involving logarithms where both the base and the argument are powers of the same number (e.g., 27 and 81 are both powers of 3), the most efficient method is to:
1.  **Find the Common Base.**
2.  **Rewrite** the base and argument using this common base ($\mathbf{\log_{a^n}(a^m) = x}$).
3.  **The value of $x$ is the ratio of the exponents:** $\mathbf{x = \frac{m}{n}}$.
This method avoids complex substitutions and simplifies directly to the answer.
### 💡 Logarithm Problem: $\mathbf{\log_5(5) = x}$

The goal is to evaluate the logarithm, $\log_5(5)$, by asking: "To what power must the base 5 be raised to equal the argument 5?"

#### 1. General Identity Property of Logarithms

The logarithm of a number to the same base is always **1**.
$$\mathbf{\log_a(a) = 1}$$

This is because, in exponential form, $\mathbf{a^1 = a}$.

---

#### 2. Worked Solution

Apply the identity property to the given expression:
$$\mathbf{\log_5(5) = 1}$$

#### 3. Formal Verification using Conversion

* **Set the expression equal to $x$:**
    $$\log_5(5) = x$$
* **Convert to Exponential Form:** (Base $a=5$, Exponent $x$, Argument $a=5$)
    $$5^x = 5$$
* **Equate Exponents:** Since $5 = 5^1$, we have:
    $$5^x = 5^1$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 1}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

This is the most fundamental logarithmic property. Always remember that $\mathbf{\log_a(a) = 1}$. This property is a direct result of the definition of a logarithm as the **exponent**.
### 💡 Logarithm Problem: $\mathbf{\log_{105}(1) = x}$

The goal is to evaluate the logarithm, $\log_{105}(1)$, by asking: "To what power must the base 105 be raised to equal the argument 1?"

#### 1. General Zero Property of Logarithms

The logarithm of **1** to any valid base is always **0**.
$$\mathbf{\log_a(1) = 0}$$

This is because, in exponential form, any valid base $\mathbf{a}$ raised to the power of $\mathbf{0}$ equals 1 ($\mathbf{a^0 = 1}$).

---

#### 2. Worked Solution

Apply the zero property to the given expression:
$$\mathbf{\log_{105}(1) = 0}$$

#### 3. Formal Verification using Conversion

* **Set the expression equal to $x$:**
    $$\log_{105}(1) = x$$
* **Convert to Exponential Form:** (Base $a=105$, Exponent $x$, Argument $1$)
    $$105^x = 1$$
* **Equate Exponents:** Since $1 = 105^0$, we have:
    $$105^x = 105^0$$
    $$\mathbf{x = 0}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

This is a fundamental logarithmic property. Always remember that $\mathbf{\log_a(1) = 0}$ as long as the base $a$ is valid ($a > 0, a \neq 1$). The logarithm's value represents the exponent needed to get the argument, and the only exponent that turns any base into 1 is 0.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When simplifying logarithms with roots:
1.  **Convert the root to a fractional exponent** (e.g., $\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$, $\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}$).
2.  **Apply the Power Rule** to move the fractional exponent to the front of the logarithm. This is a common step when preparing logarithmic expressions for further calculations or solving equations.

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

The process for simplifying logarithms with any $n$-th root is the same:
1.  **Convert the $n$-th root to a fractional exponent** ($x^{1/n}$).
2.  **Apply the Power Rule** to move the fractional exponent to the front of the logarithm. This is a crucial step for expanding or condensing logarithmic expressions.
### 📝 Evaluating Logarithmic Expression: $\mathbf{\log_6(6^3)}$

This note demonstrates how to evaluate a logarithm where the argument is a power of the base, using the Power Rule for Logarithms or direct evaluation.

#### 1. Transcribe the Expression

$$\mathbf{\log_6(6^3)}$$

#### 2. Method 1: Apply the Power Rule for Logarithms

The Power Rule states that $\mathbf{\log_b(A^n) = n \log_b(A)}$.
Bring the exponent (3) to the front as a coefficient:
$$3 \log_6(6)$$

Now, use the Identity Property: $\mathbf{\log_a(a) = 1}$.
$$3 \cdot 1$$
$$\mathbf{3}$$

#### 3. Method 2: Direct Evaluation using Definition

The logarithm $\log_6(6^3)$ asks: "To what power must 6 be raised to equal $6^3$?"
By definition, the power is directly the exponent of the argument.
$$\log_6(6^3) = \mathbf{3}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When the argument of a logarithm is the base raised to an exponent (i.e., $\mathbf{\log_b(b^n)}$):
* The logarithm directly evaluates to the **exponent** $n$.
* This is a direct consequence of the definition of logarithms and the Power Rule. It's an important property for simplifying and solving.
### 📝 Expanding Logarithm: $\mathbf{\log_4\left(w \cdot \sqrt[3]{x} \cdot y \cdot z\right)}$

The goal is to expand the single logarithm into a sum of simpler logarithms using the Product Rule and the Power Rule.

#### 1. Apply the Product Rule for Logarithms

The Product Rule states $\mathbf{\log_b(AB) = \log_b(A) + \log_b(B)}$. Since all arguments are multiplied, we can break them into individual logs added together:
$$\log_4(w) + \log_4\left(\sqrt[3]{x}\right) + \log_4(y) + \log_4(z)$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Power Rule to the Radical Term

First, convert the cube root to a rational exponent: $\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}}$.
The expression becomes:
$$\log_4(w) + \log_4(x^{1/3}) + \log_4(y) + \log_4(z)$$

Now, apply the Power Rule: $\mathbf{\log_b(A^n) = n \log_b(A)}$. Bring the exponent ($\frac{1}{3}$) down as a coefficient:

$$\mathbf{\log_4(w) + \frac{1}{3}\log_4(x) + \log_4(y) + \log_4(z)}$$

---

#### 3. Final Expanded Form

$$\mathbf{\log_4(w) + \frac{1}{3}\log_4(x) + \log_4(y) + \log_4(z)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To expand complex logarithms:
1.  **Use the Product/Quotient Rules first** to separate the terms into individual logarithms. Multiplication becomes addition ($\mathbf{+}$) and division becomes subtraction ($\mathbf{-}$).
2.  **Use the Power Rule last** to simplify any remaining exponents or radicals by moving them to the front as coefficients. Radicals must be written as fractional exponents first.
### 📝 Expanding Logarithm: $\mathbf{\log_5\left(\frac{2}{3 \cdot 7^6}\right)^4}$

The goal is to expand the single logarithm into a sum and difference of simpler logarithms, with no exponents or products/quotients left inside the log arguments.

#### 1. Apply the Power Rule (First)

The Power Rule states $\mathbf{\log_b(A^n) = n \log_b(A)}$. Bring the exponent ($\mathbf{4}$) to the front:
$$4 \cdot \log_5\left(\frac{2}{3 \cdot 7^6}\right)$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Quotient Rule

The Quotient Rule states $\mathbf{\log_b\left(\frac{A}{B}\right) = \log_b(A) - \log_b(B)}$. Separate the numerator (2) and the denominator ($3 \cdot 7^6$):
$$4 \left[ \log_5(2) - \log_5(3 \cdot 7^6) \right]$$

---

#### 3. Apply the Product Rule

The Product Rule states $\mathbf{\log_b(AB) = \log_b(A) + \log_b(B)}$. Separate the terms being multiplied in the second logarithm ($3$ and $7^6$). **Crucially**, since the whole expression is being subtracted, these resulting logs must remain subtracted:
$$4 \left[ \log_5(2) - \left(\log_5(3) + \log_5(7^6)\right) \right]$$
$$4 \left[ \log_5(2) - \log_5(3) - \log_5(7^6) \right]$$

---

#### 4. Apply the Power Rule (Again)

Apply the Power Rule to the last term, bringing the exponent ($\mathbf{6}$) to the front:
$$4 \left[ \log_5(2) - \log_5(3) - 6\log_5(7) \right]$$

#### 5. Distribute and Final Expanded Form

Distribute the outer factor of 4 to all terms inside the brackets:
$$\mathbf{4\log_5(2) - 4\log_5(3) - 24\log_5(7)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When expanding logarithms with multiple operations:
1.  **Exponents/Powers** are always handled **first**.
2.  **Products and Quotients** are handled **second**.
3.  Be extremely careful with **parentheses** when subtracting a logarithm that itself contains products or quotients (Step 3). The subtraction applies to *every* term separated in the denominator.
### 📝 Expanding Logarithm: $\mathbf{\log_8(99 \cdot \sqrt[3]{7})}$

The goal is to expand the single logarithm into a sum of simpler logarithms, with no exponents or products left inside the log arguments.

#### 1. Apply the Product Rule for Logarithms

The **Product Rule** states $\mathbf{\log_b(AB) = \log_b(A) + \log_b(B)}$. Separate the two terms being multiplied (99 and $\sqrt[3]{7}$):
$$\log_8(99) + \log_8(\sqrt[3]{7})$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Power Rule to the Radical Term

First, convert the cube root to a rational exponent: $\mathbf{\sqrt[3]{7} = 7^{1/3}}$.
The expression becomes:
$$\log_8(99) + \log_8(7^{1/3})$$

Now, apply the **Power Rule**: $\mathbf{\log_b(A^n) = n \log_b(A)}$. Bring the exponent ($\frac{1}{3}$) down as a coefficient:

$$\mathbf{\log_8(99) + \frac{1}{3}\log_8(7)}$$

---

#### 3. Final Expanded Form

$$\mathbf{\log_8(99) + \frac{1}{3}\log_8(7)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When expanding logarithms, always address products/quotients before powers. Remember that a **radical** ($\sqrt[n]{x}$) must be treated as a **fractional exponent** ($\mathbf{x^{1/n}}$) before the Power Rule can be applied.
### 📝 Expanding Logarithm: $\mathbf{\log_{10}\left(\frac{\sqrt[4]{5}}{x^2 y^3 z}\right)}$

The goal is to expand the single logarithm into a sum and difference of simpler logarithms, with no exponents or products/quotients left inside the log arguments.

#### 1. Rewrite Radical as Exponent and Apply Power Rule

First, rewrite the fourth root as a fractional exponent: $\mathbf{\sqrt[4]{5} = 5^{1/4}}$.
$$\log_{10}\left(\frac{5^{1/4}}{x^2 y^3 z}\right)$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Quotient Rule

The **Quotient Rule** states $\mathbf{\log_b\left(\frac{A}{B}\right) = \log_b(A) - \log_b(B)}$. Separate the numerator ($5^{1/4}$) and the denominator ($x^2 y^3 z$):
$$\log_{10}(5^{1/4}) - \log_{10}(x^2 y^3 z)$$

---

#### 3. Apply the Product Rule

The **Product Rule** states $\mathbf{\log_b(AB) = \log_b(A) + \log_b(B)}$.
* The first term is simple.
* The second logarithm must be separated into three subtracted terms. **Remember the subtraction applies to all terms from the denominator.**
$$\log_{10}(5^{1/4}) - \left( \log_{10}(x^2) + \log_{10}(y^3) + \log_{10}(z) \right)$$
$$\log_{10}(5^{1/4}) - \log_{10}(x^2) - \log_{10}(y^3) - \log_{10}(z)$$

---

#### 4. Apply the Power Rule (Final Step)

Apply the **Power Rule** ($\mathbf{\log_b(A^n) = n \log_b(A)}$) to bring the exponents down as coefficients:

$$\mathbf{\frac{1}{4}\log_{10}(5) - 2\log_{10}(x) - 3\log_{10}(y) - \log_{10}(z)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When expanding logarithms, terms from the **numerator** result in **positive** logarithms, and terms from the **denominator** result in **negative** logarithms. This complex expression demonstrates all three main rules of logarithms in a single problem.
### 📝 Condensing Logarithm: $\mathbf{2\log_2(6) + 4\log_2(11) + 4\log_2(5)}$

The goal is to condense the sum of three logarithms into a single logarithm by reversing the Power and Product Rules.

#### 1. Apply the Power Rule (First)

The **Power Rule** states $\mathbf{n \log_b(A) = \log_b(A^n)}$. Move the coefficients (2 and 4) to the arguments as exponents:
$$\log_2(6^2) + \log_2(11^4) + \log_2(5^4)$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Product Rule

The **Product Rule** states $\mathbf{\log_b(A) + \log_b(B) = \log_b(AB)}$. Since all terms are added, multiply their arguments together inside a single $\log_2$:
$$\mathbf{\log_2(6^2 \cdot 11^4 \cdot 5^4)}$$

---

#### 3. Final Condensed Form (and Simplification)

We can simplify the constant exponents in the argument: $6^2 = 36$.
$$\mathbf{\log_2(36 \cdot 11^4 \cdot 5^4)}$$

Also, notice that $11^4 \cdot 5^4 = (11 \cdot 5)^4 = 55^4$. The most condensed form is:
$$\mathbf{\log_2(36 \cdot 55^4)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To condense a series of logarithms:
1.  **Power Rule first:** Move all coefficients to become exponents of their respective arguments.
2.  **Product/Quotient Rules second:** Use addition to combine arguments via multiplication, and subtraction to combine arguments via division. Ensure all condensed terms have the same base.
### 📝 Condensing Logarithm: $\mathbf{5\log_9(x) + 5\log_9(z) - 15\log_9(y)}$

The goal is to condense the sum and difference of logarithms into a single logarithm by reversing the Power, Product, and Quotient Rules.

#### 1. Apply the Power Rule (First)

The **Power Rule** states $\mathbf{n \log_b(A) = \log_b(A^n)}$. Move the coefficients (5, 5, and 15) to the arguments as exponents:
$$\log_9(x^5) + \log_9(z^5) - \log_9(y^{15})$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Product and Quotient Rules (Second)

* The addition ($\mathbf{+}$) of $\log_9(x^5)$ and $\log_9(z^5)$ means their arguments multiply: $\mathbf{x^5 \cdot z^5}$ (Product Rule).
* The subtraction ($\mathbf{-}$) of $\log_9(y^{15})$ means its argument divides the others: $\mathbf{\frac{1}{y^{15}}}$ (Quotient Rule).

Combine the arguments into a single $\log_9$:
$$\mathbf{\log_9\left(\frac{x^5 z^5}{y^{15}}\right)}$$

---

#### 3. Final Condensed Form

$$\mathbf{\log_9\left(\frac{x^5 z^5}{y^{15}}\right)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

To condense logarithms:
1.  **Power Rule:** Coefficients become exponents.
2.  **Product/Quotient Rules:** Positive logs (added) correspond to terms in the **numerator** of the argument, and negative logs (subtracted) correspond to terms in the **denominator**.
3.  Ensure all logarithms share the **same base** (here, 9) before applying the Product and Quotient Rules.
### 📝 Condensing Logarithm: $\mathbf{\frac{1}{3}\log_4(x) + \frac{2}{7}\log_4(y) - 3\log_4(z)}$

The goal is to condense the sum and difference of logarithms into a single logarithm by reversing the Power, Product, and Quotient Rules.

#### 1. Apply the Power Rule (First)

The **Power Rule** states $\mathbf{n \log_b(A) = \log_b(A^n)}$. Move the coefficients ($\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{7}$, and 3) to the arguments as exponents:
$$\log_4(x^{1/3}) + \log_4(y^{2/7}) - \log_4(z^3)$$

---

#### 2. Apply the Product and Quotient Rules (Second)

* The addition ($\mathbf{+}$) of the first two terms means their arguments multiply: $\mathbf{x^{1/3} \cdot y^{2/7}}$ (Product Rule).
* The subtraction ($\mathbf{-}$) of the third term means its argument divides the others: $\mathbf{\frac{1}{z^3}}$ (Quotient Rule).

Combine the arguments into a single $\log_4$:
$$\mathbf{\log_4\left(\frac{x^{1/3} y^{2/7}}{z^3}\right)}$$

---

#### 3. Final Condensed Form (Optional Radical Notation)

We can express the fractional exponents as radicals for the final form: $x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x}$ and $y^{2/7} = \sqrt[7]{y^2}$.
$$\mathbf{\log_4\left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{x}\sqrt[7]{y^2}}{z^3}\right)}$$

***

#### 🔑 Key Takeaway

When condensing, fractional coefficients (like $\frac{1}{3}$) become **roots** in the final argument, and negative coefficients (like $-3$) correspond to exponents in the **denominator**. The order of operations is always coefficients $\to$ exponents (Power Rule), then addition/subtraction $\to$ multiplication/division (Product/Quotient Rules).
