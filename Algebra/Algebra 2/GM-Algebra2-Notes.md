## Algebra II - Lesson 1 - Sets 1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
- 'Finite Sets' = have a specific number of elements
- 'Infinite Sets' =  have an unlimited amount of elements
- $\subset$ : 'SubSets' = will contain elements of the main set, 
- $A \subset B$ : 'A' is a 'Proper Subset' of 'B', A = {1, 7, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- $\subseteq$ : 'Improper Subsets' = if 2 sets are equal (have exactly the same elements in different orders) they are considered an 'Improper Subset', G = {1, 8, 2}, D = {2, 1, 8}
- $A \subseteq B$ : 'G' is an 'Improper Subset' of 'D'
- $\mathbf{\not\subset}$ : 'Not a Subset Of' = Symbol for not a subset of, fora set to be a subset of another set, it MUST contain ALL elements from the main set (if even one is missing, it is not a subset)
- $Q \mathbf{\not\subset} L$ : 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L', Q = {a, m, n, o}, L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}, since 'm' is not in the main set 'L' , 'Q' 'IS NOT a subset of' 'L'
- $2^n$ = How many subsets can be made from a given set, where 'n' is the number of elements in the main set, $\emptyset$ counts as a set (considered a 'possible set')
### Universal Set Example

**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10.

**Universal Set (U):**
$$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$
$$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$

---

**Subsets of U:**

**Set A (Even numbers):**
$$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$
$$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$

**Set B (Numbers less than 5):**
$$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$
$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$

**Set C (Odd numbers):**
$$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$

---

**Set Notation (Relationships):**

* **Is a member of:** $5 \in U$
* **Is NOT a member of:** $12 \notin U$
* **Is a subset of:** $B \subset U$
* **No solution/Empty Set:** $A \cap C = \emptyset$ (The intersection of A and C is the empty set)

- 'Venn Diagram' = A way to visually represent the relationship between sets
- $\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$ : 'A Complement' or 'A Prime' of Set A (Elements NOT in A) = Will contain all the elements in set 'U' (Universal Set) that ARE NOT members of 'Set A'
- $\cup$  : 'Union' = Will contain everything of the sets that are united(unionized?), without double listing elements
- $A \cup B$ :  Will contain ALL the elements of set 'A' and 'B' without double listing them
-  $\cap$ : 'Intersection' = will contain only the terms in BOTH SETS that are intersected
-  $A \cap B$ : Intersection of set 'A' and 'B' = will contain only the terms that are in BOTH SETS
### Set Operations for Union and Intersection :

**Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$
**Set A:** $$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
**Set B:** $$B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

| Symbol/Operation | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{A^c}$ or $\mathbf{A'}$** | **'A Complement'** (Elements NOT in A) = All elements in $U$ that are NOT in $A$. | $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ |
| **$$\cup$$** | **'Union'** = Combine all elements from the sets, without listing duplicates. | $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ |
| **$$A \cup B$$** | Will contain **ALL** the elements of set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}$$ |
| **$$\cap$$** | **'Intersection'** = Contains **only** the elements common to both sets. | $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$ |
| **$$A \cap B$$** | **Intersection of** set 'A' and 'B'. | **(Same as above)** $$\mathbf{\{4, 5\}}$$ |
## Algebra II - Lesson 3 - Solving Linear Equations - 14October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=41m5s
- $ax + b = c$ : first degree linear equation (since 'a' is raised to the first power of 'x')
- 'a', 'b', and 'c' are representing real numbers, 'a' is the coefficient to 'x' and can not be 0
- $2x + 3 = 9$ , $x = 3$ , when you plug in '3' in to x for the equation, it should create a true statement (9=9)
- **'Addition Property Of Equality'** = You can add the same value to both sides of the equation, and it will not effect the solution
- **'Multiplication Property of Equality'** = if you multiply(or divide) one side, you need to mutliply(or divide) the other side as well with the same non-zero number, it will not effect the solution 
- **Steps to Solve** : 1) Simplify Each Side Seperately, 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation, 3) Isolate the Variable, 4) Check the solution in the original equation (To check, just plug in the value you get and check if the equality still holds true)
- Find x : Your main goal is to isolate the variable
## Algebra II - Lesson 4 - Solving Linear Equations in One Variable - 15October2025 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wrPGtP61fo&t=59m
- To clear an equation of fractions, we multiply both sides by the LCD (Lowest common denominator) of alll fractions - clear the equation of fractions to make it easier to get the answer (this isn't mandatory, just makes it easier to work with)

$$\frac{-x}{5} + \frac{1x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{1x}{2}$$
- $5 x 4 = 20$ , so the LCD is 20, so multiply both sides of the equation by 20, worked equation below
- 
#### Clearing Fractions by Multiplying by the LCD (20)

**Original Equation:**
$$\frac{-x}{5} + \frac{1x}{5} = \frac{-21}{4} + \frac{14x}{5} + \frac{3}{5} - \frac{1x}{2}$$

**Step 1: Multiply every term by the LCD, 20.**
$$20\left(\frac{-x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) = 20\left(\frac{-21}{4}\right) + 20\left(\frac{14x}{5}\right) + 20\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - 20\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$

**Step 2: Cancel denominators and multiply the remainders.**
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(-x) + 4(x)$
* $20/4 = 5 \implies 5(-21)$
* $20/5 = 4 \implies 4(14x) + 4(3)$
* $20/2 = 10 \implies -10(x)$

**Intermediate Result (No Fractions):**
$$-4x + 4x = -105 + 56x + 12 - 10x$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms on each side.**
* Left Side: $-4x + 4x = \mathbf{0}$
* Right Side: $(56x - 10x) + (-105 + 12) = \mathbf{46x - 93}$

**Final Equation Ready to Solve:**
$$0 = 46x - 93$$
