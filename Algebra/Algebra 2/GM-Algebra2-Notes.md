## Algebra II - Lesson1 - Sets1 - 14October2025 :
- A Set is a collection of things : it should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not - they should fit a certain profile/definition
- Examples of Sets : Whole Numbers {0, 1, 2,3...}, 
- The numbers in the set are known as the 'members' or 'elements' of the set
- '{}' : you enclose sets inside the curly braces/set braces
- Roster Method : {..., -2, -1 , 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, it's clear if something is in the set or not (the pattern continues...)
- The order that you list the elements of a set is not important : {1, 6, 7} = {6, 7, 1} = {7, 6, 1} 
- Use Capital Numbers to name a set : A = {0, 1, 2, 3} = Set 'A' is a list of whole numbers less than 4
- $\emptyset$ = {} : A set that contains no elements is reffed to an 'empty set' or 'null set', a set with no solutions is an example of this, a problem with no solutions would be an example of an empty set $\emptyset$ - Future Sean, DO NOT DO {$\emptyset$}, it is wrong 
- 'Solution Set' : 2x-5 = 27, x =16,  {16} = Solution Set (a set with the elements that are the solution to the problem you are working on), useful for when you start solving higher level mathematics with many solutions
- $\in$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS** a member of the set
- 7$\in$Z : '7' is an 'element' of set Z
- $\notin$ : The symbol to denote that something **IS NOT** a member of the set
- 5$\notin$ A : '5' is not an 'element' of set A
- 'U' : Universal Set = is a set that contains all elements under consideration
**Context:** The set of all positive integers less than or equal to 10. **Universal Set (U):** $$U = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 1 \le x \le 10\}$$ $$U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$$ --- **Subsets of U:** **Set A (Even numbers):** $$A = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \text{ is even}\}$$ $$A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$$ **Set B (Numbers less than 5):** $$B = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x < 5\}$$ $$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$ **Set C (Odd numbers):** $$C = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$$
