## Sets :
$\{\}$ : Set braces
$\dots$ : Continues indefinitely (Roster Method)
$\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ : Empty set / Null set
$\in$ : Is a member of (is an element of)
$\notin$ : Is NOT a member of (is NOT an element of)
$U$ : Universal Set
$\subset$ : Proper Subset of (is a subset of, but not equal to)
$\subseteq$ : Subset of or Equal to (Improper Subset)
$\not\subset$ : Is NOT a subset of
$2^n$ : Total number of subsets in a main set(where n is the number of elements)

## CheatSheet (Formulae to add to physical sheet for future Sean) :
slope intercept form = Y = mx + b
slope = rise / run = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
Point slope form = $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
**Standard Form** = $ax + by = c$ : 
Perpendicular Lines = $m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$
distance formula(pythagorean theorem) = $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
distance(motion) = rate * time 
$\frac{Pure amount of the substance}{Total amount of the mixture} = concentration of the substance$
- **Quadratic Formula** : $\mathbf{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$ : a universal tool that provides the solutions (or roots) for any quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx+c=0$ , regardless of whether the solutions are real or complex.

## Special Factors :
- **Difference of Two Squares** : $x^2 y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$ : The 2 middle terms cancel eachother
- **Perfect Square Trinomial (Addition)** : $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2$ : The middle term is **double the product** of the terms being squared.
- **Perfect Square Trinomial (Subtraction)** : $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x - y)^2$ : The middle term is **double the negative product** of the terms being squared.
- **Sum of Two Cubes** : $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **negative** middle term and always has a **positive** last term. '+' positive first parenthesis in (x +y) , '-' negative first term on second parenthesis : *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*
- **Difference of Two Cubes** : $x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$ : The trinomial factor has a **positive** middle term and always has a **positive** last term.  '-' negative first parenthesis in (x - y) , '+' positive terms on second parenthesis *The first sign is always going to match, the second sign is not going to match, and the third sign is always positive*
