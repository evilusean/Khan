## Sets :
$\{\}$ : Set braces
$\dots$ : Continues indefinitely (Roster Method)
$\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ : Empty set / Null set
$\in$ : Is a member of (is an element of)
$\notin$ : Is NOT a member of (is NOT an element of)
$U$ : Universal Set
$\subset$ : Proper Subset of (is a subset of, but not equal to)
$\subseteq$ : Subset of or Equal to (Improper Subset)
$\not\subset$ : Is NOT a subset of
$2^n$ : Total number of subsets in a main set(where n is the number of elements)

## CheatSheet (Formulae to add to physical sheet for future Sean) :
slope intercept form = Y = mx + b
slope = rise / run = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
Point slope form = $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
**Standard Form** = $ax + by = c$ : 
Perpendicular Lines = $m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$
distance formula(pythagorean theorem) = $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
distance(motion) = rate * time 
$\frac{Pure amount of the substance}{Total amount of the mixture} = concentration of the substance$
