In this course, we will continue to learn the fundamentals of Algebra. We will build on the foundation that was established in Algebra 1 and push ourselves a little bit further with the mastery of a few new concepts. In this course we will learn about: sets, linear equations & linear inequalities, graphing, functions, linear systems, matrices, exponents, polynomials, factoring, rational expressions, radicals, complex numbers, quadratic equations & quadratic inequalities, exponential & logarithmic functions, ellipses, and non-linear systems.
