Future Sean Prompt :
'give me 2 obsidian codeblocks, one the 'symbols-formulae' with a minimalist one line per symbol or formulae, and a second code block for 'symbols-formulae-explained' with a full explanation of each symbol or formulae for these notes :'
### Set Theory Symbols :

| Symbol/Formula | LaTeX Code | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **{}** | `\{\}` | **Set Braces:** Used to enclose the members (elements) of a set, whether listed (Roster Method) or defined by a rule. |
| **...** | `\dots` | **Ellipsis:** Used in the Roster Method to indicate that the pattern of elements continues indefinitely (for infinite sets) or to save space if the pattern is clear. |
| **$$\emptyset$$or$$\{\}$$** | `\emptyset \text{ or } \{\}` | **Empty Set/Null Set:** A set that contains no elements. Represents "no solution" in algebra. (Must NOT be written as $\{\emptyset\}$). |
| **$$\in$$** | `\in` | **Is a Member Of:** Denotes that an element belongs to a specific set (e.g., $7 \in Z$, read as "7 is an element of set Z"). |
| **$$\notin$$** | `\notin` | **Is NOT a Member Of:** Denotes that an element does not belong to a specific set (e.g., $5 \notin A$, read as "5 is not an element of set A"). |
| **U** | `U` | **Universal Set:** The set containing all elements under consideration in a particular problem or context. All other sets in that problem are subsets of U. |
| **$$\subset$$** | `\subset` | **Proper Subset Of:** Set A is a proper subset of B ($A \subset B$) if every element in A is also in B, AND B contains at least one element that is NOT in A (meaning $A \neq B$). |
| **$$\subseteq$$** | `\subseteq` | **Subset Of or Equal To (Improper Subset):** Set G is a subset of D ($G \subseteq D$) if every element in G is also in D. This includes the case where $G = D$. |
| **$$\not\subset$$** | `\not\subset` | **Is NOT a Subset Of:** Used when a set (Q) contains at least one element that is not found in the main set (L). |
| **$$2^n$$** | `2^n` | **Total Subsets Formula:** Calculates the total number of possible subsets that can be formed from a main set, where $n$ is the total number of elements in the main set. (Includes the empty set and the set itself). |
