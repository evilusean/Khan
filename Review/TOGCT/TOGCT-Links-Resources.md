Future Sean : Besides anki card reviews, try to do these in a few months, if you forget in a few months (likely), watch some https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA - The Organic Chemistry Tutor - Videos on whatever subject, he does a very good job explaining with examples quickly almost every math subject I've come accross (can also add those to anki for Future Future Sean) - Right now, I'm just trying to finish Algebra2 by the end of the month, and don't have much time to practice / review so I can start precalc fresh in december

I already know I'll need to do log's and exponents for at least a few days before starting calculus - check the FutureSeanProblems.md link above for a full list of stuff I need to review.
