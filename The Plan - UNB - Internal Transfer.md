## University - The Internal Transfer Strategy :
This approach leverages the university's internal assessment process. 
They are often more willing to admit a student who has demonstrated success at their institution than they are to rely on old high school grades.

### Step 1: Admission to a Less Competitive Program
First, apply to a Bachelor's degree program at the university you want to attend that has lower admission requirements than Engineering. Good options include:
Bachelor of Science (General Science): This is ideal because the first-year courses are often the same required courses as Engineering (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry).
Bachelor of Arts (General Studies): This is the easiest to get into, but you will have to be very careful to register for all the mandatory Engineering first-year courses yourself.

### Step 2: Ace the Mandatory Engineering Courses
During your first year (usually two semesters), you will deliberately register for and focus on getting high marks in the core courses that the Electrical Engineering 
  program requires in the first year. 
These usually include:
Calculus I and II
Physics (Mechanics and Electricity/Magnetism)
Linear Algebra
A basic Computing/Programming course (often C or Python)

### Step 3: The Transfer Application
After your first year (usually around May or June), you will apply to transfer internally into the Electrical Engineering program.
The Engineering faculty will mostly ignore your old high school grades.
They will primarily look at your university GPA from the first year.
You will need a very strong GPA, typically a B+ or A- average (3.3 - 3.7 GPA or higher), to be competitive for the transfer.
Crucially, if you succeed, you will enter the second year of Electrical Engineering with little to no time lost.
Advantages of this Approach
Bypasses High School GPA: Your success in rigorous university-level courses proves your competence better than old high school results ever could.
Reduced Risk: If you find the material too difficult, you haven't wasted four years; you can pivot to a Bachelor of Science degree, 
  which still satisfies the degree requirement for both the JET Programme and corporate jobs in Japan.
Saves Time: You are completing the necessary courses while earning degree credits, making it the most efficient way to catch up.
