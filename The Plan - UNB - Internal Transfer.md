## University - The Internal Transfer Strategy :
This approach leverages the university's internal assessment process. 
They are often more willing to admit a student who has demonstrated success at their institution than they are to rely on old high school grades.

### Step 1: Admission to a Less Competitive Program
First, apply to a Bachelor's degree program at the university you want to attend that has lower admission requirements than Engineering. Good options include:
Bachelor of Science (General Science): This is ideal because the first-year courses are often the same required courses as Engineering (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry).
Bachelor of Arts (General Studies): This is the easiest to get into, but you will have to be very careful to register for all the mandatory Engineering first-year courses yourself.

### Step 2: Ace the Mandatory Engineering Courses
During your first year (usually two semesters), you will deliberately register for and focus on getting high marks in the core courses that the Electrical Engineering 
  program requires in the first year. 
These usually include:
Calculus I and II
Physics (Mechanics and Electricity/Magnetism)
Linear Algebra
A basic Computing/Programming course (often C or Python)

### Step 3: The Transfer Application
After your first year (usually around May or June), you will apply to transfer internally into the Electrical Engineering program.
The Engineering faculty will mostly ignore your old high school grades.
They will primarily look at your university GPA from the first year.
You will need a very strong GPA, typically a B+ or A- average (3.3 - 3.7 GPA or higher), to be competitive for the transfer.
Crucially, if you succeed, you will enter the second year of Electrical Engineering with little to no time lost.
Advantages of this Approach
Bypasses High School GPA: Your success in rigorous university-level courses proves your competence better than old high school results ever could.
Reduced Risk: If you find the material too difficult, you haven't wasted four years; you can pivot to a Bachelor of Science degree, 
  which still satisfies the degree requirement for both the JET Programme and corporate jobs in Japan.
Saves Time: You are completing the necessary courses while earning degree credits, making it the most efficient way to catch up.

## The Essential Study List for Internal Transfer

You need to prioritize the core **Math and Physics** topics, as these are the courses that will determine your first-year GPA and, therefore, your transfer eligibility.

### 1. Mathematics (The Most Critical)

The Math sequence is the single biggest predictor of success in Engineering. Focus on mastering these concepts:

| Course                                 | Core Topics to Master                                                                                                                                             | Importance                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculus I (Differential Calculus)** | **Limits** and Continuity. **Derivatives** (rules, chain rule, implicit differentiation). Applications of the derivative (related rates, optimization, graphing). | **Highest.** Essential for all of Physics.                        |
| **Linear Algebra**                     | **Vectors** (2D/3D, dot and cross products). **Matrices** (operations, inverses, determinants). Solving systems of linear equations.                              | **High.** Key for digital systems and circuits.                   |
| **Calculus II (Integral Calculus)**    | **Integrals** (basic, substitution). Applications of the integral (area, volume, work). Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.                                          | **High.** Essential for electrical circuits and advanced physics. |
| **Pre-Calculus/Trigonometry**          | Review of trigonometric identities, logs, exponentials, and complex algebra.                                                                                      | **Foundation.** Must be quick and accurate.                       |


**Study Tip:** Work through high school or introductory university-level textbooks. Since you are applying as a mature student, look for practice problems that focus on applications rather than just theory.

## 2. Physics (Calculus-Based)

Engineering Physics is fundamentally about applying Calculus to real-world problems. Your study should mirror the two major physics courses in the first year:

| Course                                   | Core Topics to Master                                                                                                                                                                | Importance                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physics I (Mechanics)**                | **Kinematics** (motion, velocity, acceleration). **Newton's Laws** (free body diagrams are essential!). **Work, Energy, and Power.** **Momentum and Collisions.** Rotational Motion. | **Highest.** Heavily relies on Calculus I concepts.                       |
| **Physics II (Electricity & Magnetism)** | **Electrostatics** (Coulomb's Law, Electric Fields). **DC Circuits** (Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws). **Magnetism** and Magnetic Fields.                                               | **High.** Directly relates to your Electrical Engineering specialization. |

**Study Tip:** Do **calculus-based** physics problems. For example, instead of using a constant acceleration formula, use integration to find the position from the acceleration function.

## 3. Engineering & Programming Fundamentals

While Math and Physics are the most important for your GPA, studying these will help your transition immensely:

| Course                            | Core Topics to Master                                                                                                                                                | Importance                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intro to Programming (Coding)** | **C/C++ or Python** fundamentals. Basic control structures (loops, if/else). Functions and basic algorithms.                                                         | **High.** Your four years of experience should make this a GPA booster. |
| **Electric Circuits (Basic)**     | Basic circuit components (resistors, capacitors, inductors). Series and parallel circuits. **Ohm's Law (V=IR)** and **Kirchhoff's Laws** (voltage and current laws). | **Moderate.** Prepares you for the first core EE course.                |
| **Engineering Graphics/Design**   | Practice basic 2D and 3D visualization.                                                                                                                              | **Lowest priority for transfer GPA,** but essential for the course.     |

## Your 6-Month Plan:

1. **Months 1-2 (Foundation):** Aggressively review/learn Pre-Calculus/Trigonometry and master all of **Calculus I (Differential Calculus)**.
    
2. **Months 3-4 (Core I):** Master **Physics I (Mechanics)**, using your new Calculus skills. Start learning **Linear Algebra**.
    
3. **Months 5-6 (Core II):** Master **Calculus II (Integral Calculus)** and **Physics II (Electricity & Magnetism)**. Review your existing programming knowledge.
    

Your goal isn't just to pass; it's to earn an **A- average or better** in these courses to secure the internal transfer, which means rigorous, consistent practice.

You can check out this video for more context on the math involved in engineering. [All The Math You Need For Engineering: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2scszCY2oUo). The video breaks down all the high-level math you'll need to master to succeed in an engineering degree.

## Khan Academy Study Sequence :
You should start with **Pre-calculus** and work your way up to the advanced math topics, integrating the physics courses as you go.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Approx. 2 Months)

The goal here is to quickly eliminate any weaknesses in your algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric skills. This is the material your university professor will assume you already know.

1. **Algebra 1 & Algebra 2:** Review these rapidly. Look for gaps in topics like quadratic equations, factoring, rational expressions, and complex numbers.
    
2. **Trigonometry:** This is vital for Physics. Master the **unit circle**, trigonometric identities, and solving triangles (sine/cosine law).
    
3. **Pre-calculus:** This course bridges the gap between high school algebra and university calculus. Focus heavily on **functions** (domain/range, inverses, compositions) and **exponential/logarithmic functions**.
    
#### Algebra : 
##### 1. The "Skip & Test" Approach

Do not treat Algebra 1 and 2 like brand-new subjects. Instead, use them as diagnostic tools to identify and fill specific knowledge gaps.

- **Watch Videos for Concepts You Forgot:** Only watch the videos if the concept is completely unfamiliar or if you haven't seen it in years (e.g., complex fractions, specific factoring methods).
    
- **Prioritize Practice:** **Focus all your energy on the practice questions, quizzes, and unit tests.** This is the most efficient use of your time.
    
- **The 80/20 Rule:** If you consistently score **80% or higher** on a topic's practice set, move on. If you score below 80%, watch the relevant videos and retry the practice set until you reach the threshold.
    
#### Time Goal: 2 to 4 Weeks

To stay on track for your 6-month goal and to have enough time for the critical Calculus and Physics material, you should aim to complete all the necessary review in:

| Course                 | Recommended Time Goal    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Algebra 1 Review**   | **3 - 7 days**           |
| **Algebra 2 Review**   | **1 - 2 weeks**          |
| **Total Algebra Time** | **2 to 4 weeks maximum** |
### Phase 2: Core Engineering Math (Approx. 2.5 Months)

These are the most important courses that directly correspond to your first-year university GPA.

4. **Calculus 1 (Differential Calculus):** Master the concept of **limits**, all **differentiation rules** (power, product, quotient, chain), and applications like optimization and related rates.
    
5. **Calculus 2 (Integral Calculus):** Focus on the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, **integration techniques** (substitution, parts), and applications such as finding areas and volumes.
    
6. **Physics (High School Level):** Do a quick review of the mechanics section (forces, motion, energy) before tackling the calculus-based physics.
    

### Phase 3: Advanced Math and Physics Integration (Approx. 1.5 Months)

These subjects are typically covered in the second semester of first year or the start of second year. A head start here will make the end of your first year much less stressful.

7. **Linear Algebra:** This course is crucial for all engineering and coding. Focus on **Vectors**, **Matrices** (operations, determinants, inverses), and solving systems of linear equations.
    
8. **Physics (College/AP Level):** Switch to the calculus-based physics material. You need to apply your Calculus 1 skills to:
    
    - **Classical Mechanics:** Applying derivatives and integrals to concepts like velocity, acceleration, work, and potential energy.
        
    - **Electricity and Magnetism:** Reviewing charge, electric fields, circuits (Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws), and magnetic forces.

#### How to Study Effectively

- **Practice is Key:** For Engineering, knowing the material is not enough—you must be able to solve problems quickly and accurately under pressure. Do _all_ the practice exercises on Khan Academy.
    
- **Targeted Review:** When starting a new topic, always review the **Prerequisite Skills** section first. If you struggle with a specific problem type, stop and go back to the relevant lower-level course (e.g., if you fail at a rational expression in Pre-calculus, go back to Algebra 2).
    
- **Focus on the "Why":** Since you have a coding background, try to understand the mathematical concepts intuitively (e.g., a derivative is a **rate of change**; an integral is an **accumulation**). This will help you apply the math to physics and engineering problems.
